  "description": "Comprehensive framework for deep analysis of articles, papers, and long-form content using 10+ thinking models (SCQA, 5W2H, critical thinking, inversion, mental models, first principles, systems thinking, six thinking hats). Use when users want to: (1) deeply understand complex articles/content, (2) analyze arguments and identify logical flaws, (3) extract actionable insights from reading materials, (4) create study notes or learning summaries, (5) compare multiple sources, (6) transform knowledge into practical applications, or (7) apply specific thinking frameworks. Triggered by phrases like 'analyze this article,' 'help me understand,' 'deep dive into,' 'extract insights from,' 'use [framework name],' or when users provide URLs/long-form content for analysis.",
