        "question": "How many tools should my MCP server implement?",
        "answer": "Focus on the most valuable tools first. Quality matters more than quantity. Tools should enable complete workflows, not just wrap every API endpoint. Start with 3-5 core tools."

        "question": "How do I test if my MCP server works correctly?",

      {
        "question": "Is my API key secure when using MCP servers?",
        "answer": "API keys should only be passed through environment variables. Never hardcode credentials. The evaluation script accepts keys via -e KEY=VALUE parameters which keeps them secure."

      {
        "question": "Why are my tool responses being truncated?",

        "question": "How does MCP compare to direct API calls?",
        "answer": "MCP provides structured tool definitions that help LLMs understand available operations. It handles authentication, input validation, and response formatting consistently. MCP tools are discoverable and self-documenting."
