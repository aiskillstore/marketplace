  "description": "Validates that code actually works through sandbox testing, execution verification, and systematic debugging.\nUse this skill after code generation or modification to ensure functionality is genuine rather than assumed.\nThe skill creates isolated test environments, executes code with realistic inputs, identifies bugs through\nsystematic analysis, and applies best practices to fix issues without breaking existing functionality.\n",
