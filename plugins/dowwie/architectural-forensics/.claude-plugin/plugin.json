  "description": "Master protocol for deconstructing agent frameworks to inform derivative system architecture. Use when (1) analyzing an agent framework's codebase comprehensively, (2) comparing multiple frameworks to select best practices, (3) designing a new agent system based on prior art, (4) documenting architectural decisions with evidence, or (5) conducting technical due diligence on AI agent implementations. This skill orchestrates sub-skills for data substrate, execution engine, cognitive architecture, and synthesis phases.",
