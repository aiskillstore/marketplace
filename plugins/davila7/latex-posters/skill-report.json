        "question": "What are the standard poster sizes?",

      },
      {
        "question": "How do I integrate figures into my poster?",
        "answer": "Use includegraphics package for images. Ensure figures are 300+ DPI for print. Vector formats (PDF, SVG) are preferred for scalability. Include descriptive captions with key statistics."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is my data safe when using the PDF review script?",
        "answer": "The review script only reads PDF metadata using standard tools (pdfinfo, pdffonts, pdfimages). No data is transmitted or stored. The script operates locally on files you specify."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why does my poster have large white margins?",
        "answer": "Adjust margin settings in your documentclass. For beamerposter: set text margin left/right to 5mm. For tikzposter: use margin=5mm option. For baposter: add margin=5mm to documentclass."

      {
        "question": "How does this compare to PowerPoint or InDesign?",
        "answer": "LaTeX posters offer superior typographic quality, consistent formatting, and easy version control. However, they require LaTeX installation and have a steeper learning curve compared to WYSIWYG editors."
