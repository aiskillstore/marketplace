  "description": "Implements the NOWAIT technique for efficient reasoning in R1-style LLMs. Use when optimizing inference of reasoning models (QwQ, DeepSeek-R1, Phi4-Reasoning, Qwen3, Kimi-VL, QvQ), reducing chain-of-thought token usage by 27-51% while preserving accuracy. Triggers on \"optimize reasoning\", \"reduce thinking tokens\", \"efficient inference\", \"suppress reflection tokens\", or when working with verbose CoT outputs.",
