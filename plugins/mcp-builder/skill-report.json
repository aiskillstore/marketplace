        "question": "Which language should I use - Python or TypeScript?",
        "answer": "TypeScript is recommended for best SDK support, compatibility with execution environments like MCPB, and AI model proficiency. Python is also well-supported via FastMCP if you prefer it."
      },
      {
        "question": "What transport should I use - stdio or streamable HTTP?",
        "answer": "Use streamable HTTP for remote servers and multi-client scenarios (stateless JSON is simpler to scale). Use stdio for local integrations and command-line tools."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I create good evaluation questions?",
        "answer": "Create complex, realistic questions that: (1) require multiple tool calls, (2) use only read-only operations, (3) are independent of other questions, (4) have stable answers that won't change over time, (5) can be verified by string comparison, and (6) reflect real human use cases."
      },
      {
        "question": "What makes a high-quality MCP server?",
        "answer": "Quality is measured by how well LLMs can accomplish real-world tasks using your tools. Focus on: clear tool naming, comprehensive descriptions, proper pagination, actionable error messages, and passing rigorous evaluations."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I handle large result sets?",
        "answer": "Implement pagination with limit/offset parameters, return has_more and next_offset indicators, and consider a CHARACTER_LIMIT constant to truncate responses with clear messages when needed."

      {
        "question": "What are tool annotations and why do they matter?",
        "answer": "Annotations like readOnlyHint, destructiveHint, idempotentHint, and openWorldHint help clients understand tool behavior. They're hints, not security guarantees, but help AI agents use tools appropriately."
