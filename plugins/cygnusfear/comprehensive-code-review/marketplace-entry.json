  "description": "This skill should be used when reviewing pull requests, performing comprehensive code review, analyzing code changes before merge, or when the user asks for thorough/ultra-critical code review. Performs EXTREMELY CRITICAL 6-pass analysis identifying runtime failures, code consistency issues, architectural problems, environment compatibility risks, and verification strategies. Posts structured review as GitHub PR comment. Use when user asks to \"review PR\", \"review this code\", \"review changes\", \"check this PR\", \"analyze PR\", \"post review\", or for Phase 3 of devflow. Supports parallel review mode with multiplier (code-review-3, code-review 6X) for consensus-based reviews. This is an ultra-critical reviewer that does not let things slip and desires only perfection.",
