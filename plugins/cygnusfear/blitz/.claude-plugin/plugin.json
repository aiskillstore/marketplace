  "description": "This skill should be used when parallelizing multi-issue sprints using git worktrees and parallel Claude agents. Use when tackling multiple GitHub issues simultaneously, when the user mentions \"blitz\", \"parallel sprint\", \"worktree workflow\", or when handling 3+ independent issues that could be worked on concurrently. Orchestrates the full workflow from issue triage through parallel agent delegation to sequential merge.",
