      {

      },
      {
        "question": "What are the system requirements?",
        "answer": "Requires Python 3.8+ with pip install of pypdf, pdfplumber, reportlab, pdf2image, and PIL. Poppler must be installed for PDF to image conversion."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I fill a scanned PDF that is not fillable?",
        "answer": "Use the non-fillable form workflow: convert PDF to images, manually determine text entry locations, create fields.json with bounding boxes, then use fill_pdf_form_with_annotations.py."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is my data safe when processing PDFs?",
        "answer": "Yes. All processing is local using Python libraries. No data is sent to external servers. Files are only read from and written to paths you specify."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why does my filled PDF show annotations in the wrong position?",
        "answer": "This usually indicates incorrect coordinate transformation. PDF coordinates start from bottom-left while image coordinates start from top-left. Verify your bounding box conversion logic."
      },
      {
        "question": "How is this different from using pdf-lib in JavaScript?",
        "answer": "The Python tools provide more mature text extraction and table parsing. pdf-lib is better suited for browser environments or Node.js projects that need to create or modify PDFs client-side."
