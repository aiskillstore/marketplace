        "question": "How do I know if my skill description will trigger correctly?",

      {
        "question": "What's progressive disclosure and why does it matter?",
        "answer": "Progressive disclosure is a three-level loading system: (1) metadata always in context, (2) SKILL.md loaded when skill triggers, (3) references/scripts loaded as needed. This keeps context efficient—Claude only loads what's necessary for the current task."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I use the init_skill.py script for plugin skills?",
