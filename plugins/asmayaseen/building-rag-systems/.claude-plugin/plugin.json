  "description": "Build production RAG systems with semantic chunking, incremental indexing, and filtered retrieval.\nUse when implementing document ingestion pipelines, vector search with Qdrant, or context-aware\nretrieval. Covers chunking strategies, change detection, payload indexing, and context expansion.\nNOT when doing simple similarity search without production requirements.\n",
