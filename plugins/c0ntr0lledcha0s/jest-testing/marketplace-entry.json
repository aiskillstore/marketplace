  "description": "Automatically activated when user works with Jest tests, mentions Jest configuration, asks about Jest matchers/mocks, or has files matching *.test.js, *.test.ts, jest.config.*. Provides Jest-specific expertise for testing React, Node.js, and JavaScript applications. Also applies to Vitest due to API compatibility. Does NOT handle general quality analysis - use analyzing-test-quality for that.",
