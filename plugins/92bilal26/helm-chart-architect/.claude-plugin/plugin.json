Activate when designing new Helm charts for Kubernetes deployments, evaluating\nchart architecture, making decisions about component packaging, or reviewing charts for\nextensibility and maintainability. Guides decision-making about dependencies, lifecycle\nhooks, configuration surface, and multi-environment deployment through context-specific\nreasoning rather than generic best practices.\n",
