    "best_practices": [
      "Provide comprehensive context upfront during Stage 1 - dump everything you know about the project, stakeholders, constraints, and background",
      "Use numbered shorthand when responding to questions (e.g., '1: yes, 2: no, 3: see #channel-name') for efficiency",
      "Start with sections that have the most unknowns rather than writing sequentially",
      "Give specific feedback during refinement (e.g., 'Make paragraph 3 more concise') rather than general comments",
      "Enable MCP connectors for Slack, Teams, or document storage to allow direct context pulling",
      "Complete Reader Testing stage even if document feels done - it catches blind spots authors miss",
      "Use appendices for depth without bloating main sections",
      "Link to relevant Slack threads, docs, or this conversation in appendices for future reader context"
    ],
    "anti_patterns": [
      "Skipping context gathering and jumping straight to drafting - leads to multiple revision rounds later",
      "Editing the document directly instead of indicating what to change - prevents the skill from learning your style",
      "Answering brainstorming questions with vague responses like 'looks good' instead of numbered selections",
      "Skipping Reader Testing because the doc 'seems clear' - authors have context bias",
      "Writing all sections sequentially without focusing on high-uncertainty areas first",
      "Providing minimal context and expecting the skill to fill in gaps with generic content"

    "faq": [
      {
        "question": "How long does this workflow take compared to writing freeform?",
        "answer": "The workflow takes longer upfront but typically results in fewer revision rounds after sharing. Most users complete documents in 1-2 focused sessions. You can always switch to freeform if the structure feels too constraining."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I use this for shorter documents like emails or brief updates?",
        "answer": "This workflow is optimized for substantial documentation (specs, proposals, decision docs). For shorter content, the overhead may not be worth it - freeform writing is likely more efficient."
      },
      {
        "question": "What if I don't have access to sub-agents for Reader Testing?",
        "answer": "The skill provides manual testing instructions - you'll open a fresh Claude conversation at claude.ai, paste the document, and ask the predicted reader questions yourself. It's slightly more work but equally effective."
      },
      {
        "question": "Do I need to have a template before starting?",
        "answer": "No, templates are optional. If you have one, the skill will use it. If not, it will suggest appropriate sections based on your document type (spec, proposal, RFC, etc.)."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I skip stages or jump around?",
        "answer": "Yes, you have full agency to adjust the process. You can skip stages, work freeform, or request specific modifications. The skill will ask for confirmation before major deviations."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do MCP integrations help with this workflow?",
        "answer": "MCP connectors (Slack, Teams, Google Drive, SharePoint) let the skill directly read team channels, shared documents, and related context instead of requiring you to copy-paste everything. This makes context gathering much faster."
