      "Keep emoji animations under 2-3 seconds (12-30 frames) for faster loading",

      "Don't use emoji fonts - they're unreliable across platforms and Slack clients",
      "Don't create too many frames (>50) for emoji GIFs - file size explodes",
      "Avoid linear motion without easing - it looks robotic and unpolished",
      "Don't assume pre-packaged graphics exist in the skill - draw from scratch with PIL",
      "Don't over-optimize - 48 colors is usually the sweet spot, going lower degrades quality noticeably",

      },
      {
        "question": "How do I reduce my GIF file size?",
        "answer": "Use fewer frames (lower FPS or shorter duration), reduce colors (num_colors=48), enable remove_duplicates=True, use optimize_for_emoji=True, or reduce dimensions to 128x128."

      {
        "question": "Can I use uploaded images in animations?",

        "question": "What animation effects are available?",

        "question": "How do I make graphics look polished, not basic?",
