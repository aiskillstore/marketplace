      {
        "question": "How many frames should my GIF have?",
        "answer": "Keep emoji GIFs around 12 frames (under 3 seconds) and message GIFs under 30 frames. Use lower FPS (10-15) to reduce file size."

      },
      {
        "question": "Why does my GIF have a large file size?",
        "answer": "Large file sizes result from high frame counts, many colors, or large dimensions. Use fewer frames (10-15), limit colors to 48, and resize to 128x128 for emoji GIFs."
      },
      {
        "question": "How does this skill compare to online GIF makers?",
