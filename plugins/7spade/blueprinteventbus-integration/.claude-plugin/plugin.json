  "description": "Implement event-driven communication using BlueprintEventBus for cross-module coordination. Use this skill when modules need to communicate without tight coupling, broadcasting domain events (task.created, member.added), subscribing to events with proper lifecycle management, and implementing event-driven workflows. Ensures events follow naming conventions ([module].[action]), include Blueprint context, and use takeUntilDestroyed() for automatic cleanup.",
