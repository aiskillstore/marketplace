## Core Concept

Design your ideal life first, then calculate what it costs. Work backward from lifestyle to income requirements.

## Components

### Monthly Lifestyle Cost Calculation
- Current baseline expenses
- Ideal lifestyle additions (travel, experiences, possessions)
- Total monthly target

### Dreamlines
Specific lifestyle goals with concrete costs:
- What do you want to HAVE? (things)
- What do you want to BE? (qualities, skills)
- What do you want to DO? (experiences)

### Target Monthly Income (TMI)
```
TMI = (Monthly Lifestyle Cost + Monthly Savings Target) × 1.3
```
(1.3 accounts for taxes and buffer)

### Gap Analysis
- Current income vs. TMI
- Time available vs. time needed
- Concrete steps to close the gap

## Implementation Questions

1. What does your ideal day look like?
2. What does it cost per month?
3. What's the gap between current and ideal?
4. What's the fastest path to close that gap?
