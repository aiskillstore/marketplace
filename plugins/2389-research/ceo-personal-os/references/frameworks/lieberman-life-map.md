## The 6 Domains

| Domain | Focus Areas |
|--------|-------------|
| **Career** | Role, impact, growth, fulfillment |
| **Relationships** | Family, friends, community, partnership |
| **Health** | Physical, mental, energy, longevity |
| **Meaning** | Purpose, contribution, legacy |
| **Finances** | Security, freedom, generosity |
| **Fun** | Play, adventure, creativity, rest |

## Quarterly Assessment

Rate each domain 1-10:
- 1-3: In crisis
- 4-6: Needs attention
- 7-8: Healthy
- 9-10: Thriving

## Imbalance Detection

Look for:
- Any domain below 5 (urgent attention needed)
- Gap > 3 between highest and lowest (imbalance)
- Domain stuck at same rating for 3+ quarters (stagnation)

## Integration Questions

1. Which domain, if improved, would lift the others?
2. Which domain am I avoiding looking at?
3. What would a "10" look like in my weakest domain?
4. What trade-offs am I making between domains?
