# Eisenmann Startup Failure Patterns

Credit: "Why Startups Fail" by Tom Eisenmann (Harvard Business School)

## The Six Failure Patterns

| Pattern | Stage | Description |
|---------|-------|-------------|
| **Bad Bedfellows** | Early | Wrong team, investors, or partners sink the venture despite a good idea |
| **False Starts** | Early | "Fail fast" taken too far—launching before researching customer needs |
| **False Positives** | Early | Early adopter success misleads about mainstream market demand |
| **Speed Traps** | Late | Hypergrowth leads to disaster as CAC rises and margins erode |
| **Help Wanted** | Late | Financing risk + management gaps during rapid scaling |
| **Cascading Miracles** | Late | Too many "do or die" things must go right—betting on improbable outcomes |

## Diamond-and-Square Framework

All eight elements must align:

**Diamond (Opportunity):**
- Customer Value Proposition - Strong, unmet need + sustainable differentiation
- Technology & Operations - Can you build and deliver it?
- Marketing - Can you reach customers cost-effectively?
- Profit Formula - Unit economics, LTV/CAC > 3, path to break-even

**Square (Resources):**
- Founders - Right skills, experience, temperament
- Team - Balance of attitude and skill
- Investors - Aligned interests, patient capital, value-add beyond money
- Partners - Reliable strategic relationships

## Four Types of Entrepreneurial Risk

1. **Demand Risk** - Will customers actually want this?
2. **Technological Risk** - Can we build what we envision?
3. **Execution Risk** - Can we attract and manage the right people?
4. **Financing Risk** - Can we raise capital when we need it?

## Key Metrics to Monitor

| Metric | Target | Warning Sign |
|--------|--------|--------------|
| Unit Economics | Positive gross profit per unit | Losing money on every transaction |
| LTV/CAC Ratio | > 3.0 | Below 1.0 = doomed |
| Cash Runway | 12-18 months | Less than 6 months |
| Customer Acquisition Cost | Stable or declining | Rising faster than LTV |

## Running on Empty

The hardest decision: When to quit vs. persevere. Warning signs:
- Burning capital investors will never recover
- Team members investing time in doomed venture
- Persisting past point where turnaround odds are minuscule
- "Hope springs eternal" rationalization overriding data

## Quarterly Review Questions

- Which failure patterns might we be vulnerable to right now?
- Is our Diamond-Square alignment strong?
- What are our current risk levels across the four types?
- Are we tracking toward our key metrics targets?
- If we're struggling, is this a smart bet that hasn't paid off, or are we Running on Empty?
