  "description": "Process large document corpora (1000+ docs, millions of tokens) through knowledge graph construction and stateful multi-hop reasoning. Use when (1) User provides a large corpus exceeding context limits, (2) Questions require connections across multiple documents, (3) Multi-hop reasoning needed for complex queries, (4) User wants persistent queryable knowledge from documents. Replaces brute-force document stuffing with intelligent graph traversal.",
