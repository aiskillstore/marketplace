# Tier Design Strategies: How Tiers Work Together as Systems

**Purpose**: Teach the strategic design of tier relationships, not just individual tier features.

**Key Insight**: Tiers are not just different prices—they're a SYSTEM designed to influence buying decisions through psychological positioning.

## Core Principle: Tiers as Decision Systems

### The Fundamental Misunderstanding

**WRONG Mental Model**:
> "I have 3 tiers with different features at different prices. Done."

**RIGHT Mental Model**:
> "My tiers are designed to work TOGETHER to guide customers toward a specific buying decision using psychological pricing principles."

### Why This Matters

Tiers interact with each other:
- **Higher tiers anchor lower tiers** (make them feel affordable)
- **Middle tiers can be decoys** (positioned to make premium obvious)
- **Lower tiers can be decoys** (positioned to make middle obvious)

The relationship BETWEEN tiers is as important as the features IN each tier.

## The 3 Tier Relationship Patterns

### Pattern 1: Anchor Positioning

**Purpose**: Make base/middle tier feel affordable by contrast

**Structure**:
- Base tier: $X
- Premium tier: $3X to $5X (3-5x multiplier)

**Psychology**: Relief & Value
- Customer sees premium price first (or simultaneously)
- Thinks: "Wow, that's expensive"
- Then sees base tier
- Thinks: "Oh, that's much more reasonable—I'll save money with base"

**When to Use**:
- Want to maximize VOLUME at base tier
- Premium tier is genuine offering (10-20% might buy it)
- Using price contrast to make base feel like smart choice

**Example**:
- Base: $97/month (community + weekly calls)
- Premium: $497/month (community + weekly calls + monthly 1:1 + done-for-you support)
- **Result**: 80% choose Base (feels like great value), 20% choose Premium (worth it for hands-on support)

**Hormozi Mechanism**: Mechanism #8 (Anchor Upsell)

---

### Pattern 2: Decoy Positioning

**Purpose**: Make premium tier the obvious choice through minimal price difference

**Structure**:
- Middle tier: $X
- Premium tier: $1.1X to $1.3X (10-30% more)

**Psychology**: Comparison & Value Stacking
- Customer compares middle to premium
- Premium is "only $100 more"
- Premium includes extras that seem worth way more than $100
- Thinks: "For just $100 more, I get all that? No-brainer!"

**When to Use**:
- Want to maximize PREMIUM tier adoption
- Premium tier is your highest-margin offering
- Middle tier exists primarily to make premium look obvious

**Example**:
- Middle: $897/year (community access + courses)
- Premium: $997/year (community + courses + monthly 1:1 calls + priority support)
- **Price difference**: Only $100 (11% more)
- **Perceived value difference**: $1000+ (monthly calls alone = $200/mo value)
- **Result**: 60-70% choose Premium ("only $100 more!"), 30-40% choose Middle

**Hormozi Mechanism**: Mechanism #3 (Decoy Offer)

**Critical Math**:
- 10-30% price increase (sweet spot: 10-20%)
- Perceived value increase: 100-300%
- Makes premium tier feel like "stealing"

---

### Pattern 3: Value Ladder

**Purpose**: Clear separation for different customer segments by budget

**Structure**:
- Basic: $X
- Pro: $2X to $3X (2-3x multiplier)
- Elite: $5X to $10X (5-10x multiplier)

**Psychology**: Self-Selection
- Each tier clearly different audience/need
- No single tier is "obvious" choice
- Customers self-select based on budget + needs

**When to Use**:
- Diverse audience with wide budget range
- Genuine value separation at each level
- Want clear segmentation (DIY, DWY, DFY)

**Example**:
- Basic: $47/month (DIY - courses only, community)
- Pro: $147/month (DWY - courses + group coaching + templates)
- Elite: $497/month (DFY - everything + 1:1 implementation + done-for-you)
- **Result**: Clear segments—beginners in Basic, serious in Pro, businesses in Elite

**Not a single Hormozi mechanism** - this is value ladder strategy

## The 2x Pricing Trap (ANTI-PATTERN)

### Why 2x Multipliers Are Dangerous

**The Problem**:
- 2x price feels expensive but not premium
- Falls into uncomfortable psychological middle ground
- Not close enough for decoy effect
- Not far enough for anchor effect

**Example of 2x Trap** (From Post-Mortem Session 2):
- Tier 2: $997/year
- Tier 3: $1,997/year (exactly 2x)
- **Customer Thought Process**: "That's double the price... is it worth it? Feels like a lot..."
- **Result**: Psychological barrier, hesitation, lower conversion

### The Psychology of 2x

**Why 2x Feels Wrong**:
1. **Doubling** triggers mental math → "This is double!"
2. Feels like a **test**: "Are they seeing if I'll pay 2x?"
3. Not close enough to feel like "only a bit more"
4. Not far enough to feel like "premium tier"
5. Creates **decision paralysis**: "Is this worth double?"

### How to Fix 2x Pricing

**Option A: Make It Decoy (1.1-1.3x)**
- Tier 2: $997/year
- Tier 3: $1,197/year (20% more)
- **Now** Tier 3 feels obvious: "Only $200 more for direct access!"

**Option B: Make It Anchor (3-5x)**
- Tier 2: $997/year
- Tier 3: $4,997/year (5x more)
- **Now** Tier 2 feels affordable: "I don't need premium, Tier 2 is great value"

**Option C: Maintain 2x BUT Change What's Being Compared**
- If keeping $997 and $1,997, they must be CLEARLY DIFFERENT products (not DIY vs DWY)
- Example: Tier 2 = Community, Tier 3 = Community + Done-For-You Agency Service
- Now 2x makes sense because you're not just getting "more," you're getting a DIFFERENT solution

## Tier Relationship Math

### Quick Reference Table

| Price Multiplier | Pattern | Effect | Example |
|-----------------|---------|--------|---------|
| 1.1-1.3x (10-30%) | Decoy | Premium feels obvious | $897 → $997 |
| 1.5-1.9x (50-90%) | Awkward zone | Decision friction | Avoid |
| 2.0x (100%) | **2x TRAP** | Psychological barrier | $997 → $1,997 ❌ |
| 2.5-2.9x | Value Ladder | Moderate separation | $497 → $1,297 |
| 3-5x | Anchor | Base feels affordable | $97 → $497 |
| 5-10x | Premium Anchor | Clear luxury positioning | $997 → $9,997 |

**Golden Rule**: Avoid the 1.5x-2.5x range unless value difference is DRAMATICALLY clear.

## Decision Architecture: How Customers Choose

### Simultaneous Presentation (All Tiers Visible)

**What Happens**:
1. Customer sees all options at once
2. Starts with highest price (anchor)
3. Compares down to find "best value"
4. Decision influenced by price relationships

**Design Strategy**:
- **Anchor Pattern**: Show premium first (highest price) → makes others feel affordable
- **Decoy Pattern**: Place decoy next to target → makes target obvious choice
- **Value Ladder**: Clear separation → self-selection by budget

**Skool Note**: Tiers display in fixed order (can't customize). Work with this constraint.

## Strategic Positioning: What Do You Want Most People to Buy?

### Scenario A: Want Most in Base Tier

**Use Anchor Pattern**:
- Base: $97/month (TARGET - want 70-80% here)
- Premium: $497/month (ANCHOR - only 20-30% here)
- Premium exists to make Base feel like great value

**Tier 3 Role**: "Make Tier 1 feel affordable"

### Scenario B: Want Most in Premium Tier

**Use Decoy Pattern**:
- Middle: $897/year (DECOY - only 30-40% here)
- Premium: $997/year (TARGET - want 60-70% here)
- Middle exists to make Premium feel like no-brainer

**Tier 2 Role**: "Make Tier 3 feel obvious"

### Scenario C: Want Even Distribution

**Use Value Ladder**:
- Clear separation at each tier (2-3x multipliers)
- Distinct audiences for each tier
- No single tier is "obvious" choice
- Let customers self-select

---

## Feature Overlap Strategy

### The Decoy's Secret: 90% Feature Overlap

**Principle**: To make premium tier a no-brainer, give middle tier 90% of features at 50% of the price.

**Example**:
- Middle Tier ($897/year): Community + All Courses + Group Calls
- Premium Tier ($997/year): Community + All Courses + Group Calls + Monthly 1:1 + Priority Support

**Analysis**:
- Feature overlap: 90% (almost everything is the same)
- Price difference: 11% (only $100 more)
- Exclusive features: 1:1 calls + priority support (high perceived value)
- **Result**: "For $100 more I get 1:1 calls? That's worth it!"

**When NOT to Use**:
- If tiers are genuinely different solutions (DIY vs DFY)
- If price difference is large (3-5x)
- If you want even distribution across tiers

---

## Tier Naming Psychology

### Names That Guide Decisions

**Anchor Pattern** (want most in Base):
- Base: "Community" or "Core" (sounds complete)
- Premium: "Elite" or "Concierge" (sounds exclusive but not necessary)
- **Effect**: Base feels like "everything I need"

**Decoy Pattern** (want most in Premium):
- Middle: "Standard" or "Basic" (sounds incomplete)
- Premium: "Complete" or "Full Access" (sounds like what you should get)
- **Effect**: Middle feels like "missing something"

**Value Ladder** (want even distribution):
- DIY: "Self-Paced" or "Starter"
- DWY: "Guided" or "Pro"
- DFY: "Done-For-You" or "Premium"
- **Effect**: Clear progression, self-selection

## Common Mistakes & How to Fix Them

### Mistake #1: Comparing Different Products as Payment Options

**Wrong**: "Tier 3 annual ($1,997) saves $500 vs Tier 2 monthly ($1,164 annualized)"

**Why Wrong**: Tier 3 and Tier 2 are DIFFERENT products, not payment options

**Fix**: Compare same tier (Tier 2 monthly vs Tier 2 annual) OR compare same payment type (Tier 2 annual vs Tier 3 annual)

### Mistake #2: Random Price Points with No Strategy

**Wrong**:
- Tier 1: $47/month
- Tier 2: $127/month (2.7x)
- Tier 3: $497/month (3.9x from Tier 2, 10.6x from Tier 1)

**Why Wrong**: No clear pattern, relationships feel arbitrary

**Fix**: Choose a pattern (Anchor, Decoy, or Ladder) and design ratios intentionally

### Mistake #3: Decoy Too Expensive

**Wrong**:
- Middle: $897/year
- Premium: $1,497/year (67% more)

**Why Wrong**: 67% price increase breaks decoy effect—too much difference

**Fix**: Keep decoy within 10-30% of premium for maximum effect

## Tier Design Worksheet

### Step 1: Define Goal
- [ ] Want most people in: Base | Middle | Premium?
- [ ] Pattern to use: Anchor | Decoy | Ladder?

### Step 2: Set Anchor (Highest Price)
- [ ] Premium tier price: $_______
- [ ] Why this price?: _______________

### Step 3: Calculate Relationships
- [ ] If Decoy Pattern: Premium × 0.77-0.91 = Middle price
- [ ] If Anchor Pattern: Premium ÷ 3-5 = Base price
- [ ] If Ladder Pattern: Premium ÷ 2-3 = Middle, ÷ 5-10 = Base

### Step 4: Verify Math
- [ ] Base to Middle multiplier: _____x
- [ ] Middle to Premium multiplier: _____x
- [ ] Is any ratio in the 1.5x-2.5x danger zone? ___
- [ ] If yes, adjust to 1.1-1.3x (decoy) or 3-5x (anchor)

### Step 5: Feature Allocation
- [ ] If Decoy: 90% feature overlap between middle and premium
- [ ] If Anchor: Clear value separation between base and premium
- [ ] If Ladder: Distinct solutions at each tier (DIY/DWY/DFY)

## Integration with Hormozi Mechanisms

### Mechanism #3: Decoy Offer
**Applied to Tiers**: Middle tier priced 10-30% below premium makes premium obvious choice

**Example Implementation**:
- Middle: $897/year (complete feature set)
- Premium: $997/year (same features + 1:1 calls)
- Customer sees $100 difference for huge additional value → chooses Premium

### Mechanism #8: Anchor Upsell
**Applied to Tiers**: Premium tier 3-5x higher makes base tier feel affordable

**Example Implementation**:
- Base: $97/month (community access)
- Premium: $497/month (community + done-for-you)
- Customer sees $497, thinks "expensive," then sees $97, thinks "great deal!" → chooses Base

## Validation: Is Your Tier Structure Strategic?

**Ask These Questions**:

1. **Can you explain the role of each tier?**
   - If not → you don't have a strategy, just prices

2. **Which tier do you WANT most people to buy?**
   - If "I don't know" → design isn't strategic

3. **What psychological effect are your price ratios creating?**
   - If "none" → reconsider ratios

4. **Would you adjust any tier to influence buying behavior?**
   - If "no" → you're not thinking about tiers as a system

5. **Are any of your ratios in the 1.5x-2.5x danger zone?**
   - If "yes" → that's your first fix

tier_names = ["Base", "Pro", "Premium"]

result = validate_tier_relationships(tier_prices, tier_names)
print(result)

# Output includes:
# - Multipliers between each tier
# - Pattern detection (Anchor/Decoy/Ladder)

## Summary: The Strategic Mindset

**Bad Tier Design** (Feature-Focused):
> "Tier 1 has X, Tier 2 has X+Y, Tier 3 has X+Y+Z. Done."

**Good Tier Design** (Psychology-Focused):
> "I want 70% in Tier 1. Tier 3 exists to anchor Tier 1 as affordable. Tier 2 bridges the gap for those who need more but can't afford Tier 3. Price ratios: 1x → 2x → 5x for clear separation."

**Exceptional Tier Design** (System-Focused):
> "Tier 2 ($897) is a decoy positioned 11% below Tier 3 ($997) with 90% feature overlap. This makes Tier 3 the no-brainer choice for serious buyers. Tier 1 ($97) exists for budget-conscious members and as entry point for future upgrades. Expected distribution: 20% Tier 1, 20% Tier 2, 60% Tier 3."

**Remember**: Tiers are not just prices—they're a decision architecture designed to guide customers toward optimal buying behavior.
