## Tone and Style Guidelines

### Professional Yet Approachable

**Do**: Use conversational but clear language, write like you speak (but edited)

**Don't**: Use corporate jargon or buzzwords, sacrifice clarity for cleverness

**Example**:
- ❌ "We are pleased to announce that the strategic initiative has reached its preliminary milestone."
- ✅ "Great news! We've hit our first major milestone on the customer portal redesign."

### Transparency and Authenticity

**Do**: Share both good news and challenges, admit when you don't know something

**Don't**: Spin bad news into forced positivity, hide problems until critical

### Inclusive Language

**Do**: Use gender-neutral language, be mindful of cultural differences, consider time zones

**Don't**: Use unnecessarily gendered language, use phrases like "obviously" or "simply"

### Action-Oriented Messaging

**Do**: Use active voice, start with verbs, make requests specific, set clear deadlines

**Don't**: Use passive voice excessively, be vague about expectations

**Example**:
- ❌ "A decision needs to be made about the framework."
- ✅ "Sarah, please decide which framework we're using by Friday."

### Appropriate Formality by Context

**Formal** (All-hands, policy changes): Complete sentences, professional tone, minimal emoji

**Semi-Formal** (Status reports, team updates): Conversational but professional, occasional emoji

**Informal** (Slack, quick updates): Conversational and brief, emoji and GIFs appropriate

## Common Pitfalls and Solutions

**Burying the Lede**: Start with the most important information first

**Inconsistent Formatting**: Use templates, maintain style guides

**Lack of Action Items**: Always include clear next steps and owners

**Missing Context**: Explain the "why" behind decisions and changes

**Technical Jargon**: Use plain language, explain technical terms
