      "Don't skip the visual validation step when filling non-fillable forms - bounding boxes must be verified",

    "faq": [
      {
        "question": "How do I fill out a PDF form?",
        "answer": "First run check_fillable_fields.py to determine if it has fillable fields. If yes, use extract_form_field_info.py and fill_fillable_fields.py. If no, follow the multi-step visual analysis process in forms.md: convert to images, identify field bounding boxes, create validation images, verify accuracy, then fill with annotations."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can this skill handle scanned PDFs?",
        "answer": "Yes, but scanned PDFs require OCR. Convert the PDF to images using convert_pdf_to_images.py, then use pytesseract to extract text from the images."
      },
      {
        "question": "What's the difference between fillable and non-fillable forms?",
        "answer": "Fillable forms have defined form fields that can be programmatically populated. Non-fillable forms are just visual layouts where you must determine field locations visually and add text annotations at the correct coordinates."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why do I need to validate bounding boxes?",
        "answer": "Bounding box validation ensures text appears in the correct location without overlapping labels or other fields. The validation images show you exactly where text will be placed before creating the final PDF."
      },
      {
        "question": "Which library should I use for extracting tables?",
        "answer": "Use pdfplumber - it's specifically designed for table extraction and handles complex layouts much better than basic text extraction libraries."
