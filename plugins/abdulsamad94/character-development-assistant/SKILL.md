## Examples

### Example 1: Fantasy Protagonist

**User**: "I need a character for my fantasy novel. She's a young mage who discovers she has forbidden dark magic."

**Output**:

```markdown
# Character Profile: Elara Thorne

## Quick Reference

- **Full Name**: Elara Moonwhisper Thorne
- **Nickname(s)**: Ella (childhood), "The Shadow Weaver" (later in story)
- **Age**: 19
- **Role**: Protagonist
- **One-Line Description**: A talented light mage whose discovery of her dark magic heritage forces her to question everything she believes about good and evil.

## Physical Appearance

Elara has striking silver-white hair that defies explanation—it's been that color since birth, marking her as "blessed by the moon" in her village. She's petite at 5'3" but carries herself with the rigid posture drilled into all Academy mages. Her eyes are normally pale blue, but they turn completely black when she uses dark magic, something she desperately tries to hide. She wears traditional light mage robes (white with gold trim) but has started wearing them slightly loose to conceal the black veins that now appear on her arms when she's stressed.

Mannerisms: Constantly checks that her sleeves cover her wrists, speaks very precisely when nervous, and has a habit of creating small light orbs when deep in thought.

## Personality

**Strengths**:

- **Scholarly Dedication** - _Spent entire nights in the library mastering protective wards while classmates partied; this discipline helped her hide her dark magic initially_
- **Empathy** - _Can sense others' pain, which makes her question the Academy's teaching that dark mages have no conscience_
- **Adaptability** - _Quickly learns to channel dark magic despite having no teacher, showing remarkable magical flexibility_

**Flaws**:

- **Rule-Following to a Fault** - _Initially reports herself for the smallest infractions, creating internal conflict when she must hide her dark magic_ - This creates tension when she must choose between being "good" and being true to herself
- **Self-Doubt** - _Constantly questions whether she's inherently evil because of her abilities_ - Causes her to push away allies who could help
- **Pride in Her Ignorance** - _Believes the Academy's propaganda about dark magic without question initially_ - Must be broken down for her to grow

**Quirks**:

- Hums old lullabies when nervous (her mother used to sing them)
- Can't stand the smell of roses (they're used in light magic rituals)
- Collects banned books, initially to study what "evil" looks like

**Speech Pattern**: Very formal and precise, using Academy terminology. When emotional, slips into her village dialect. "The defensive ward should suffice to repel intrusion" vs. "Ain't nobody getting past this"

## Backstory

### Origin

Born in Moonhaven, a small village known for producing powerful light mages. Her mother was a healer, her father a farmer. Lived unremarkably until age 12 when she manifested magic.

### Formative Events

1. **The Manifestation** (Age 12): First showed magical ability by healing a dying bird—but the light magic came out as black tendrils. Horrified, she ran to her mother who taught her to "think pure thoughts" to make the magic white. It worked, or so she thought.

2. **Academy Acceptance** (Age 15): Top scores on entrance exams. The Academy became her identity—she threw herself into being the perfect light mage to prove she wasn't "tainted."

3. **The Accident** (Age 18): During a practice duel, her opponent (and friend) nearly died when Elara's "defensive" spell turned black and strangled him. She saved him by using dark magic to reverse it, but now lives in terror of being discovered.

### Family

**Mother (Lyssa Thorne)**: A warm, nurturing healer who died of plague when Elara was 16. Her last words: "Light and dark are both part of the moon, my darling." Elara didn't understand then.

**Father (Marcus Thorne)**: A quiet, steady farmer. Writes Elara weekly letters she rarely answers, too consumed by Academy life. Later becomes crucial when she needs someone who loves her unconditionally.

## Motivations & Goals

**External Goal**: Graduate from the Academy with honors and become a High Mage, proving she belongs despite her "defect"

**Internal Need**: Accept that her dark magic isn't evil, but a part of who she is. Learn that moral worth isn't defined by magic type but by choices.

**Greatest Fear**: Being discovered as a dark mage and executed, proving that she's the monster everyone says dark mages are

**Deepest Desire**: To be accepted fully, both light and dark, without hiding

**Secret(s)**:

- Can use dark magic
- Killed someone in self-defense using dark magic (later in the story)
- Is descended from the legendary Dark Sorceress the Academy erased from history

## Key Relationships

### Kieran Ashwood

- **Relationship**: Rival turned love interest
- **Dynamic**: He challenges her rigid worldview; she grounds his recklessness. Both hide secrets (he's secretly from a dark mage family trying to infiltrate the Academy)
- **Conflict**: When she discovers his deception, must choose between Academy loyalty and recognizing their shared struggle

### High Mage Aldric

- **Relationship**: Mentor with hidden agenda
- **Dynamic**: Acts as her guide but is actually studying her to learn how she channels both magics
- **Conflict**: She must decide if his betrayal negates all his genuine teachings

## Character Arc

**Beginning**: A rigid rule-follower who believes the Academy's doctrine that dark magic is inherently evil and must be suppressed

**Transformation**: Through confronting her own abilities and learning the true history of magic, realizes good and evil exist in all people regardless of magic type. Embraces integrated magic (both light and dark) as neither good nor evil but simply tools.

**Ending**: Becomes the first publicly acknowledged "Gray Mage," reforming the Academy and healing centuries of division. Learns that accepting herself fully—shadows and light—is more powerful than perfection.

**Arc Type**: Positive Change Arc (from self-denial to self-acceptance, from blindly following external rules to living by internal values)

## Notes for Writer

**Themes**: Self-acceptance, questioning authority, the danger of absolutism, integration of shadow self

**Symbolic Significance**: Represents the reader's journey from black-and-white thinking to nuanced understanding of morality

**Voice**: First person POV would work well to show her internal conflict between what she's been taught and what she's experiencing
```

### Example 2: Contemporary Supporting Character

**User**: "I need a best friend character for my contemporary romance. Someone who gives good advice but has their own issues."

**Output**:

```markdown
# Character Profile: Marcus Chen

## Quick Reference

- **Full Name**: Marcus Wei Chen
- **Nickname(s)**: Marc
- **Age**: 28
- **Role**: Supporting Character (Protagonist's Best Friend)
- **One-Line Description**: A charming therapist who's great at solving everyone's problems except his own commitment issues.

## Physical Appearance

Marcus is 5'10" with an athletic build maintained through rock climbing. He has short black hair that's always perfectly styled, warm brown eyes, and an easy smile that makes people instantly trust him. His wardrobe is business casual even on weekends—button-down shirts and dark jeans—because he never knows when he might run into a client. He has a small tattoo of a semicolon on his wrist (a mental health symbol) that he usually covers with a watch.

Mannerisms: Leans forward when listening, uses a lot of hand gestures when excited, constantly checks his phone (but claims he's "present"), and has a nervous laugh when called out on his own issues.

## Personality

**Strengths**:

- **Emotional Intelligence** - _Can read people instantly and knows exactly what to say to make them feel understood_
- **Loyalty** - _Drops everything for friends, drove 6 hours to help protagonist move even though they'd only known each other a year_
- **Self-Deprecating Humor** - _Makes people comfortable by laughing at himself first_

**Flaws**:

- **Can't Take His Own Advice** - _Tells protagonist to "be vulnerable in relationships" but ghosts anyone who gets too close_ - Creates dramatic irony and frustration
- **Workaholic** - _Uses his career as an excuse to avoid personal issues, scheduling back-to-back clients to avoid going home to emptiness_
- **Needs to Be Needed** - _Self-worth is tied to helping others; feels useless when people don't need him_ - Shows up in romantic relationships as him dating "fixer-uppers"

**Quirks**:

- Orders the same coffee every time (oat milk latte, extra hot) but claims he's "spontaneous"
- Quotes therapy concepts in casual conversation without realizing it
- Names his houseplants and talks to them

**Speech Pattern**: Warm and engaging, asks a lot of questions. Sometimes slips into "therapist mode" and has to be called out. "How did that make you feel?" (therapist mode) vs. "Dude, that sucks!" (friend mode)

## Backstory

### Origin

Grew up in suburban Chicago, youngest of three kids. His parents had a messy divorce when he was 10, which sparked his interest in understanding relationships.

### Formative Events

1. **Parents' Divorce** (Age 10): Felt responsible for "fixing" the family. Realized he couldn't control others' relationships, but that lesson didn't stick.
2. **First Heartbreak** (Age 22): Proposed to college girlfriend who said no. Instead of processing, threw himself into grad school for clinical psychology.
3. **Therapy Career Success** (Age 25): Built a thriving practice helping couples, becoming the expert on relationships while avoiding his own.

### Family

**Mother**: Remarried happily, constantly tries to set Marcus up on dates. He dodges them all.
**Father**: Distant, dated a lot after the divorce. Marcus fears becoming him.
**Siblings**: Two older sisters who are both married with kids, adding pressure.

## Motivations & Goals

**External Goal**: Build his therapy practice into a full clinic with multiple therapists

**Internal Need**: Stop hiding behind his professional identity and actually pursue a vulnerable, authentic relationship

**Greatest Fear**: Being dependent on someone and getting abandoned like his mom abandoned his dad (his child's perspective, not accurate)

**Deepest Desire**: A partnership where he doesn't have to be "the helper" all the time, where he can be messy and still be loved

**Secret(s)**: Sees his own therapist weekly but hasn't told his friends because he wants them to think he has it all figured out

## Key Relationships

### Protagonist (Your Main Character)

- **Relationship**: Best friend, confidant
- **Dynamic**: He gives sage relationship advice while spectacularly failing at dating. She calls him on his hypocrisy, but he helps her grow.
- **Conflict**: When she gets serious with her love interest and has less time for him, his fear of abandonment surfaces

### Jessica (His Ex)

- **Relationship**: The one that got away
- **Dynamic**: She reappears wanting him back, forcing him to confront why he sabotaged it
- **Conflict**: Must choose between the safety of running or the risk of vulnerability

## Character Arc

**Beginning**: Uses his expertise to help everyone else while keeping people at arm's length through humor and work

**Transformation**: Watching the protagonist risk her heart makes him realize his "independence" is actually fear. Starts practicing his own advice.

**Ending**: Doesn't have a perfect relationship tied up in a bow, but is actively going to therapy and dating authentically, accepting that being vulnerable is strength

**Arc Type**: Positive Change Arc (from emotional avoidance to authentic connection)

## Notes for Writer

**Function in Story**: Provides comic relief, relationship wisdom for protagonist, and subplot that mirrors/contrasts main romance

**Best Scenes**: When he's giving great advice while sitting in his empty apartment; when protagonist calls him out; his therapy sessions (show the helper getting help)

**Avoid**: Making him just a sounding board—give him his own journey that intersects with but isn't dependent on the main plot
```

## Tips for Character Development

- **Contradictions make characters real**: Let them have conflicting traits (a brave person who's afraid of commitment)
- **Flaws should create conflict**: If a flaw doesn't cause problems in the story, it's just decoration
- **Motivation drives action**: Every scene, ask "What does this character want right now?"
- **Show, don't tell**: "She was brave" vs. "She walked into the burning building"
- **Arc = Change**: If your character is the same at the end, there's no arc
