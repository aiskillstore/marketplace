      {
        "question": "What's the difference between agents and commands?",

      },
      {
        "question": "How many triggering examples should I include?",
        "answer": "Minimum 2 examples, recommended 3-4 examples covering explicit requests, implicit needs, proactive triggers, and edge cases. More than 6 makes descriptions too long."
      },
      {
        "question": "What model should I use for my agent?",
        "answer": "Use 'inherit' to match the parent model unless your agent needs specific capabilities. This balances performance and cost effectively."

        "question": "How do I test if my agent triggers correctly?",
        "answer": "Create test scenarios using phrasing similar to your examples. Verify Claude loads the agent and check it provides expected functionality. Iterate on examples if triggering is unreliable."
      },
      {
        "question": "What tools should my agent have access to?",
        "answer": "Follow least privilege: Read-only analysis agents need ['Read', 'Grep', 'Glob']. Code generators need ['Read', 'Write', 'Grep']. Testing agents need ['Read', 'Bash', 'Grep']. Omit the tools field only if full access is required."
      },
      {
        "question": "How long should my system prompt be?",
        "answer": "Minimum 20 characters, optimal 500-3,000 characters. Prompts over 10,000 characters see diminishing returns. Focus on clear structure: role, responsibilities, process, quality standards, output format, and edge cases."
