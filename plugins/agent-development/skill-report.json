    "faq": [
      {
        "question": "When should I create an agent vs a command?",
        "answer": "Agents are FOR autonomous work that requires multiple steps, decision-making, and independent operation. Commands are FOR user-initiated actions that are direct and immediate. If the task requires Claude to analyze, decide, and act autonomously, use an agent."
      },
      {
        "question": "How many triggering examples should I include in the description?",
        "answer": "Include 2-4 examples minimum. Cover at least one explicit request and one proactive/implicit trigger. More than 6 examples makes descriptions too long. Focus on the most important scenarios with varied phrasing."
      },
      {
        "question": "What's the difference between 'model: inherit' and specifying a model?",
        "answer": "'inherit' uses the same model as the parent conversation (recommended for consistency). Specify 'sonnet', 'opus', or 'haiku' only if your agent needs specific model capabilities (e.g., opus for complex reasoning, haiku for speed)."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I validate my agent file?",
        "answer": "Use the provided validation script: scripts/validate-agent.sh agents/your-agent.md. This checks YAML frontmatter structure, required fields, field formats, system prompt presence and length, and example blocks in descriptions."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I use AI to generate agent configurations?",
        "answer": "Yes! Use the agent-creation-system-prompt.md template with Claude. Provide your requirements in natural language, and Claude will return a JSON configuration with identifier, whenToUse (with examples), and systemPrompt that you can convert to an agent file."
      },
      {
        "question": "What tools should I restrict my agent to?",
        "answer": "Follow the principle of least privilege. Read-only analysis agents: ['Read', 'Grep', 'Glob']. Code generation: ['Read', 'Write', 'Grep']. Testing: ['Read', 'Bash', 'Grep']. Only omit the tools field if the agent genuinely needs access to all tools."
      },
      {
        "question": "How long should my system prompt be?",
        "answer": "Aim for 500-3,000 characters for most agents. Minimum 20 characters (validation requirement), maximum 10,000 (diminishing returns). Include role, responsibilities, process steps, quality standards, output format, and edge cases."
      },
      {
        "question": "What should I include in the commentary block of examples?",
        "answer": "Explain WHY this agent should trigger in this scenario. Include decision logic, what signals indicate this agent is appropriate, and how it differs from other agents. This helps Claude's triggering mechanism understand when to use your agent."
