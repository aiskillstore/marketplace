    "faq": [
      {
        "question": "What's the difference between an agent and a command in Claude Code?",
        "answer": "Agents are autonomous subprocesses that handle complex, multi-step tasks independently. Commands are user-initiated actions. Use agents for work that requires multiple steps and decision-making, use commands for single actions triggered explicitly by users."
      },
      {
        "question": "How many triggering examples should I include in the description?",
        "answer": "Include 2-4 concrete examples. Cover at least one explicit request and one proactive/implicit trigger. More than 6 examples makes the description too long."
      },
      {
        "question": "When should I restrict tools instead of giving full access?",
        "answer": "Always restrict tools to the minimum needed (principle of least privilege). For read-only analysis agents use ['Read', 'Grep', 'Glob'], for code generators use ['Read', 'Write', 'Grep'], for testing use ['Read', 'Bash', 'Grep']. Only grant full access if truly necessary."
      },
      {
        "question": "Should I use AI-assisted generation or write agents manually?",
        "answer": "Start with AI-assisted generation using the provided system prompt for comprehensive, consistent results. Then refine manually for project-specific patterns, custom tool combinations, or precise triggering conditions. This combines speed with customization."
      },
      {
        "question": "What model should I specify in the frontmatter?",
        "answer": "Use 'inherit' in most cases so the agent uses the same model as the parent. Only specify sonnet/opus/haiku if the agent has specific capability or cost requirements."
      },
      {
        "question": "How long should my system prompt be?",
        "answer": "Aim for 500-3,000 characters (standard agent). Minimum viable is ~500 words with role, 3 responsibilities, 5-step process, and output format. Maximum is 10,000 characters before diminishing returns. Quality and specificity matter more than length."
      },
      {
        "question": "What goes in the <commentary> blocks in examples?",
        "answer": "Explain WHY the agent should trigger in this scenario. Include decision logic like 'Code was just written, proactively review for quality' or 'Explicit security analysis request triggers the security-analyzer agent.' This helps Claude understand triggering conditions."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I test if my agent triggers correctly?",
        "answer": "Create test scenarios using similar phrasing to your examples. Use the agent in real situations and verify it triggers when expected. Check that the agent follows its system prompt process steps and produces the defined output format."
