Use when creating skills, modifying skill-rules.json, understanding triggers (keywords, intent, file, content), working with hooks (UserPromptSubmit, PreToolUse, Stop), debugging activation, implementing guardrails, or building memory-aware skills that persist context across sessions. Covers 500-line rule, session tracking, enforcement levels (block, suggest, warn), plan-approval workflows, and best practices.",
