  "description": "Use this skill for processing and analyzing large tabular datasets (billions of rows) that exceed available RAM. Vaex excels at out-of-core DataFrame operations, lazy evaluation, fast aggregations, efficient visualization of big data, and machine learning on large datasets. Apply when users need to work with large CSV/HDF5/Arrow/Parquet files, perform fast statistics on massive datasets, create visualizations of big data, or build ML pipelines that do not fit in memory.",
