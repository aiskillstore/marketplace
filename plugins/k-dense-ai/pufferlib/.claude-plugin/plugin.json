  "description": "High-performance reinforcement learning framework optimized for speed and scale. Use when you need fast parallel training, vectorized environments, multi-agent systems, or integration with game environments (Atari, Procgen, NetHack). Achieves 2-10x speedups over standard implementations. For quick prototyping or standard algorithm implementations with extensive documentation, use stable-baselines3 instead.",
