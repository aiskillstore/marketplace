  "description": "Production-ready reinforcement learning algorithms (PPO, SAC, DQN, TD3, DDPG, A2C) with scikit-learn-like API. Use for standard RL experiments, quick prototyping, and well-documented algorithm implementations. Best for single-agent RL with Gymnasium environments. For high-performance parallel training, multi-agent systems, or custom vectorized environments, use pufferlib instead.",
