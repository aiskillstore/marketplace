  "description": "Comprehensive toolkit for protein language models including ESM3 (generative multimodal protein design across sequence, structure, and function) and ESM C (efficient protein embeddings and representations). Use this skill when working with protein sequences, structures, or function prediction; designing novel proteins; generating protein embeddings; performing inverse folding; or conducting protein engineering tasks. Supports both local model usage and cloud-based Forge API for scalable inference.",
