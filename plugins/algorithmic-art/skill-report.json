    "faq": [
      {
        "question": "What's the difference between this and just asking Claude to create art?",
        "answer": "This skill follows a two-phase process: first creating an algorithmic philosophy (a computational aesthetic manifesto), then implementing it as interactive p5.js code with seeded randomness and parameter controls. It produces self-contained HTML artifacts with professional UI that can be explored, exported, and reproduced deterministically."
      },
      {
        "question": "Do I need to know JavaScript or p5.js to use this?",
        "answer": "No coding knowledge required. The skill handles all implementation. You simply describe the aesthetic or concept you want, and it creates both the philosophical framework and the working code."
      },
      {
        "question": "What does 'seeded randomness' mean and why does it matter?",
        "answer": "Seeded randomness means each artwork can be perfectly reproduced from its seed number. The same seed always generates identical output. This is crucial for NFTs, archival purposes, and sharing specific variations you discover while exploring."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I customize the generated art after it's created?",
        "answer": "Yes! The HTML artifact includes interactive controls for all key parameters (particle counts, speeds, colors, etc.) and seed navigation to explore infinite variations. You can also edit the HTML file directly to modify the algorithm."
      },
      {
        "question": "What art styles can this create?",
        "answer": "It specializes in algorithmic/generative art: flow fields, particle systems, recursive structures, noise patterns, geometric compositions, and emergent behaviors. It creates ORIGINAL algorithmic art, not copies of existing artists' styles."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I use the generated HTML file?",
        "answer": "The HTML file is completely self-contained. You can: 1) View it directly in Claude.ai as an artifact, 2) Save and open it in any web browser, 3) Share the file with others (no server needed), 4) Export PNG images using the built-in download button."
      },
      {
        "question": "What's the 'algorithmic philosophy' and why create it first?",
        "answer": "The algorithmic philosophy is a 4-6 paragraph manifesto defining a computational aesthetic movement - how ideas manifest through code, noise, particles, and emergence. Creating it first ensures the final algorithm has conceptual depth and intentionality, not just random visual effects."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I create multiple variations of the same concept?",
        "answer": "Absolutely! Each artwork includes seed navigation (prev/next/random buttons) to explore infinite variations of the same algorithm. You can jump to specific seeds or browse sequentially to find variations you like."
