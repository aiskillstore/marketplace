        "question": "What's the difference between this and AI image generation?",
        "answer": "This creates procedural art—beauty emerges from algorithmic execution, not AI models. Every visual element is deterministic and reproducible. The artist controls the algorithm; randomness is controlled via seeds. This gives you precise creative control over emergence patterns."

      {
        "question": "Can I animate the output?",
        "answer": "Yes. Set `draw()` to run continuously rather than calling `noLoop()`. The animation will be smooth and reproducible for the same seed. You can adjust animation speed via parameters."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I increase visual quality/resolution?",
        "answer": "Increase canvas size in `createCanvas()` (e.g., 2000x2000 for high-res). Be mindful of performance—larger canvases with many particles may reduce frame rate. For high-resolution exports, generate at larger size, then export PNG."

      {
        "question": "What if I want to use a different graphics library?",
        "answer": "The skill is optimized for p5.js. The algorithmic philosophy can be adapted to Three.js, Processing, Openframeworks, or other libraries, but you'd need to modify the template and implementation yourself."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I share my generative art?",
        "answer": "The HTML artifact is self-contained. Save it as a `.html` file and share it directly. Anyone can open it in any modern browser without installation. You can also screenshot/export PNG from within the artifact."

      {
        "question": "Can I combine multiple algorithms?",

        "question": "How do I ensure my artwork looks intentional, not random?",
