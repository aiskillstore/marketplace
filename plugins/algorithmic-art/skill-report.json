    "faq": [
      {
        "question": "What's the difference between this and just asking Claude to create p5.js art?",
        "answer": "This skill enforces a two-step creative process (philosophy then implementation), uses Art Blocks-style seeded randomness for reproducibility, provides professional Anthropic-branded templates, and ensures self-contained interactive artifacts with parameter exploration. It's a complete framework for professional generative art."
      },
      {
        "question": "Do I need to know p5.js to use this skill?",
        "answer": "No. The skill handles all p5.js implementation. You provide creative direction and concepts; Claude generates the algorithmic philosophy and implements it as working interactive art with parameter controls."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I use this for NFT collections or commercial projects?",
        "answer": "Yes, the skill is Apache 2.0 licensed. The generated art is yours. However, ensure you're creating original algorithmic concepts rather than copying existing artists' work to avoid copyright issues."
      },
      {
        "question": "What does 'seeded randomness' mean and why does it matter?",
        "answer": "Seeded randomness means the same seed number always produces identical output. This is critical for Art Blocks-style generative art where each piece should be reproducible. It lets you explore variations (seeds 1-100) while maintaining consistency and enables collectors to verify authenticity."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I modify the generated HTML to add features or change styling?",
        "answer": "Yes, the HTML is fully editable. The template provides the foundation, but you can customize the algorithm, add parameters, modify colors, or enhance functionality. The p5.js code is inline and accessible."
      },
      {
        "question": "What if I want animated art instead of static compositions?",
        "answer": "The skill supports both. Specify 'animated' or 'evolving over time' in your request. The algorithm will update each frame in draw() instead of generating once. You can control animation speed and behavior through parameters."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I create 100 variations of the same artwork?",
        "answer": "The artifact includes seed navigation by default. Use prev/next buttons to cycle through seeds, or type specific seed numbers (1-100) in the input field. Each seed produces a unique variation of the same algorithm."
      },
      {
        "question": "What kinds of algorithms can this skill create?",
        "answer": "Particle systems, flow fields, recursive structures, L-systems, circle packing, Voronoi tessellation, cellular automata, agent-based systems, noise-based landscapes, interference patterns, fractal generation, and any other computational aesthetic that can be expressed through p5.js."
