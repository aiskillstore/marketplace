      {
        "question": "How do I integrate with existing logging systems?",
        "answer": "The skill provides a format specification. Output JSON logs to stdout or your existing log collector. Most platforms can parse JSON-formatted logs."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is my data safe with this logging pattern?",
        "answer": "This is a documentation pattern. You control what data goes into logs. Avoid logging passwords, tokens, or sensitive user data."

      {
        "question": "Logs are not appearing in my service - what to check?",
        "answer": "Verify you are using the correct correlation ID format, including it in all related log entries, and that your log output destination is properly configured."

      {
        "question": "How does this compare to OpenTelemetry tracing?",
        "answer": "This provides a simpler, lightweight alternative for correlation-based tracing. For full distributed tracing with spans, consider OpenTelemetry as a more comprehensive solution."
