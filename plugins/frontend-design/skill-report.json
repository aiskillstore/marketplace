      "Implementing timid, evenly-distributed color palettes instead of bold, dominant schemes",
      "Adding scattered micro-interactions without focusing on high-impact orchestrated moments",
      "Using solid color backgrounds when atmospheric effects would add more depth",
      "Applying minimal effort to minimalist designs (minimalism requires extreme precision and attention to detail)",
      "Converging on the same aesthetic choices (like Space Grotesk) across multiple projects",
      "Holding back creative vision due to assumed constraints not specified by the user",

    "faq": [
      {
        "question": "What frameworks and technologies does this skill support?",
        "answer": "The skill supports all major frontend technologies including vanilla HTML/CSS/JS, React, Vue, and other modern frameworks. It adapts implementation to your specified technical requirements while maintaining design quality across platforms."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I get the best results from this skill?",
        "answer": "Provide clear context about your project's purpose, target audience, and desired tone. Specify any technical constraints (framework, performance requirements, accessibility needs). The more specific you are about the feeling or aesthetic direction you want, the better the output will match your vision."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can this skill work within existing brand guidelines?",
        "answer": "Yes, if you specify brand requirements (colors, fonts, tone) upfront, the skill will work within those constraints while still finding creative ways to make the design distinctive and memorable. Include any style guides or design system references in your request."
      },
      {
        "question": "What's the difference between minimalist and maximalist approaches?",
        "answer": "Both require equal effort and intentionality. Minimalist designs demand extreme precision in spacing, typography, and subtle details. Maximalist designs need elaborate implementation with extensive animations, layered effects, and rich visual details. The skill matches complexity to aesthetic vision."
      },
      {
        "question": "Will the generated code be production-ready?",
        "answer": "Yes, the skill focuses on creating functional, production-grade code with attention to performance and accessibility. However, you should review and test the output in your specific environment, especially for complex integrations or specific technical requirements."
      },
      {
        "question": "How does this avoid generic 'AI slop' aesthetics?",
        "answer": "The skill deliberately avoids common AI design patterns by: choosing distinctive fonts beyond the usual suspects, committing to bold aesthetic directions tailored to context, creating unexpected layouts and spatial compositions, using atmospheric backgrounds instead of flat colors, and varying choices across different projects."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I request specific aesthetic directions or styles?",
        "answer": "Absolutely. You can specify directions like brutalist, art deco, retro-futuristic, organic/natural, editorial, industrial, or any other aesthetic. The more specific you are about the desired feeling and tone, the better the skill can execute that vision with precision."
