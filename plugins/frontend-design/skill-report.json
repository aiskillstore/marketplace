      "Consider accessibility alongside aesthetics (contrast, motion preferences, semantic HTML)",
      "Test across different viewports and ensure responsive design",
      "Vary design choices between projects - avoid converging on common patterns",

      "Applying the same design patterns (like Space Grotesk font) across different projects",
      "Using solid color backgrounds when atmospheric effects would enhance the design",
      "Scattering animations randomly instead of orchestrating cohesive motion design",
      "Choosing timid, evenly-distributed color palettes instead of dominant colors with sharp accents",

    "faq": [
      {
        "question": "What makes this different from other frontend design approaches?",

      },
      {
        "question": "Should I always use maximalist designs?",
        "answer": "No - both maximalist and minimalist approaches work when executed with precision and intentionality. The key is committing fully to a clear aesthetic direction that matches your project's purpose, not defaulting to generic middle-ground solutions."
      },
      {
        "question": "What frameworks does this work with?",
        "answer": "This skill can generate code for vanilla HTML/CSS/JS, React, Vue, and other frontend frameworks. Specify your technical requirements in the prompt for framework-specific implementations."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I ensure accessibility with bold designs?",
        "answer": "The skill considers accessibility alongside aesthetics - maintaining proper contrast ratios, using semantic HTML, respecting motion preferences, and ensuring keyboard navigation. Bold design and accessibility are complementary, not contradictory."
      },
      {
        "question": "What if I don't know what aesthetic direction to choose?",
        "answer": "Provide context about your project's purpose, audience, and goals. The skill will propose an appropriate aesthetic direction based on these factors, but you can also request specific styles (brutalist, retro-futuristic, editorial, etc.) or ask for options."
