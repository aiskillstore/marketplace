      },
      {
        "question": "How do I get a specific aesthetic style?",
        "answer": "Be explicit about the tone and aesthetic direction in your prompt. Use descriptive terms like 'brutalist', 'minimalist', 'retro-futuristic', 'editorial', or describe the mood you want. The more context about purpose and audience, the better."
      },
      {
        "question": "Will the generated code be production-ready?",
        "answer": "Yes, the skill focuses on generating functional, production-grade code with proper structure, accessibility considerations, and performance in mind. However, you should still review and test the code in your specific environment."

      {
        "question": "How can I ensure I get unique designs each time?",
        "answer": "The skill is designed to avoid repetitive patterns by varying aesthetic choices. Providing different context, audiences, and tones for each project will naturally lead to diverse outputs. Request specific aesthetic directions to push creativity further."

      {
        "question": "Can this skill create backend functionality?",
        "answer": "No, this skill focuses exclusively on frontend design and implementation. It creates the visual interface and client-side interactions but does not generate server-side code or database logic."
