name: Global Error Handling
description: Implement robust error handling with user-friendly messages, specific exception types, fail-fast validation, centralized error boundaries, graceful degradation, and proper resource cleanup. Use this skill when writing try-catch blocks, raising exceptions, handling API errors, validating input, implementing error boundaries, managing external service failures, or ensuring resource cleanup. Apply when working with error handling code in any language, exception classes, error middleware, API error responses, retry logic, or any code that needs to handle failures gracefully while maintaining system stability and providing clear feedback to users.

# Global Error Handling

## When to use this skill

- When writing try-catch blocks or exception handling code
- When raising, throwing, or creating custom exceptions
- When implementing error boundaries in React or other frameworks
- When handling API errors or external service failures
- When validating user input or preconditions
- When implementing retry strategies for transient failures
- When creating error middleware for APIs or applications
- When managing resource cleanup (file handles, connections, locks)
- When designing error messages for end users
- When implementing graceful degradation for non-critical failures
- When working with finally blocks or cleanup mechanisms
- When centralizing error handling at application boundaries
- When logging errors or integrating with error monitoring services

This Skill provides Claude Code with specific guidance on how to adhere to coding standards as they relate to how it should handle global error handling.
