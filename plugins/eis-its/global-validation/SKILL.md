name: global-validation
description: Implement comprehensive server-side validation with allowlists, type checking, input sanitization, and consistent error messages, while using client-side validation for user experience. Use this skill when validating user input, form data, API requests, implementing security checks, preventing injection attacks, checking data types/formats/ranges, or providing validation feedback. Apply when working with form validation, API endpoint validation, input sanitization, business rule enforcement, or any code that accepts and validates external data to ensure security, data integrity, and proper user feedback across all entry points.

# Global Validation

## When to use this skill

- When implementing form validation in frontend or backend code
- When validating API request parameters or payloads
- When checking user input for type, format, or range requirements
- When implementing server-side validation for security and data integrity
- When adding client-side validation for immediate user feedback
- When sanitizing user input to prevent injection attacks (SQL, XSS, command)
- When validating business rules (sufficient balance, valid dates, etc.)
- When creating validation error messages for users
- When implementing allowlist-based validation patterns
- When ensuring validation is applied consistently across all entry points
- When validating required fields or checking for missing data
- When working with form libraries or validation frameworks
- When reviewing code for security vulnerabilities related to input validation

This Skill provides Claude Code with specific guidance on how to adhere to coding standards as they relate to how it should handle global validation.
