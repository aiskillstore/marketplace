name: testing-test-writing
description: Write minimal, focused tests for core user flows and critical paths during development, testing behavior rather than implementation with clear test names and mocked dependencies. Use this skill when writing unit tests, integration tests, test files, test cases for critical workflows, or mocking external dependencies. Apply when working with test files (.test.js, .spec.ts, _test.py), test frameworks (Jest, RSpec, pytest), testing user journeys, or implementing fast-executing tests that validate business-critical functionality without over-testing implementation details or edge cases during feature development.

# Testing Test Writing

## When to use this skill

- When writing unit tests or integration tests for new features
- When creating test files (.test.js, .spec.ts, _test.py, etc.)
- When testing core user flows and critical business paths
- When implementing tests for primary user workflows
- When mocking external dependencies (APIs, databases, file systems)
- When writing test cases with clear, descriptive names
- When focusing on testing behavior rather than implementation details
- When ensuring tests execute quickly (milliseconds for unit tests)
- When completing feature implementation and adding strategic tests
- When working with test frameworks (Jest, Mocha, RSpec, pytest, JUnit)
- When determining appropriate test coverage for business-critical code
- When refactoring tests to reduce brittleness or improve clarity
- When setting up test fixtures or test data

This Skill provides Claude Code with specific guidance on how to adhere to coding standards as they relate to how it should handle testing test writing.
