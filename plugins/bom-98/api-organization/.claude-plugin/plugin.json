  "description": "Explains the standardized API organization pattern for this codebase. Use when creating new API endpoints, API clients, or modifying existing API structure. Covers the 5-file system (endpoint-types, endpoints, api-client, admin-api-client, protected-endpoints), role-based access patterns (admin vs regular users), and TypeScript type safety across the API layer. All API code lives in src/lib/api/ following this exact pattern.",
