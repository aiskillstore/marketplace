      {
        "question": "What are accessible names and why do they matter?",
        "answer": "Accessible names are what screen readers announce for interactive elements. Every button, link, and input must have a meaningful accessible name so users with visual impairments can understand and navigate the interface."
      },
      {
        "question": "When should I use ARIA versus native HTML?",
        "answer": "Always prefer native HTML elements with built-in accessibility. Use ARIA only when native elements cannot express the required semantics. Remember: if you can use a native button, do not use a div with role='button'."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I test if my accessibility fixes work?",
        "answer": "Use keyboard-only navigation (Tab, Shift+Tab, Enter, Escape), screen reader testing (NVDA, VoiceOver), and browser accessibility inspectors. The skill provides guidance but does not replace manual testing."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is focus trapping in dialogs?",
        "answer": "Focus trapping keeps keyboard focus inside a modal dialog while it is open. Users should not be able to tab to elements behind the dialog. When the dialog closes, focus must return to the element that opened it."
