    "faq": [
      {
        "question": "What's the difference between agents and commands in Claude Code plugins?",
        "answer": "Agents are autonomous subprocesses for complex, multi-step tasks that operate independently. Commands are user-initiated actions that execute when explicitly called. Use agents for work requiring multiple steps and decision-making, use commands for direct user-triggered actions."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I make my agent trigger proactively instead of waiting for explicit requests?",
        "answer": "Include proactive triggering examples in the description field showing the agent being called after relevant work is completed (e.g., after writing code, before commits). Use commentary to explain why the agent should trigger in these scenarios."
      },
      {
        "question": "What should I set for the model field?",
        "answer": "Use 'inherit' (recommended) unless your agent needs specific model capabilities. This makes the agent use the same model as its parent, ensuring consistency. Only use 'sonnet', 'opus', or 'haiku' if you have specific performance or cost requirements."
      },
      {
        "question": "How many triggering examples should I include?",
        "answer": "Include 2-4 concrete examples covering: explicit requests, proactive triggering, different phrasings of the same intent, and edge cases. More than 6 examples makes descriptions too long."
      },
      {
        "question": "What tools should I grant my agent access to?",
        "answer": "Follow the principle of least privilege - grant only the minimum tools needed. Common sets: read-only analysis ['Read', 'Grep', 'Glob'], code generation ['Read', 'Write', 'Grep'], testing ['Read', 'Bash', 'Grep']. Omit the tools field only if full access is required."
      },
      {
        "question": "How long should my system prompt be?",
        "answer": "Aim for 500-3,000 characters for standard agents. Minimum is 20 characters, maximum recommended is 10,000. Include clear structure with responsibilities, process steps, quality standards, output format, and edge cases."
