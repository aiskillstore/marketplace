      {

      },
      {
        "question": "How many examples should I include in the description?",
        "answer": "Include 2-4 concrete examples. Minimum 2 to cover explicit and proactive triggering. Maximum 6 to avoid excessive length. The sweet spot is 3-4 examples covering different phrasings and scenarios."
      },
      {
        "question": "Should I restrict tools for my agent?",
        "answer": "Yes, follow the principle of least privilege. If your agent only needs to read and analyze, restrict to ['Read', 'Grep', 'Glob']. Only grant all tools if the agent genuinely needs them."
      },
      {
        "question": "What model should I choose?",
        "answer": "Use 'inherit' unless you have specific needs. This makes the agent use the same model as the parent context. Only specify sonnet/opus/haiku if the agent has unique requirements (e.g., opus for complex reasoning, haiku for speed)."
      },
      {
        "question": "How long should the system prompt be?",
        "answer": "Aim for 500-3,000 characters. Minimum 20 characters to be functional. Maximum 10,000 before diminishing returns. Include role, responsibilities, process steps, quality standards, output format, and edge cases."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I test if my agent triggers correctly?",
        "answer": "Create test scenarios using similar phrasing to your examples. Verify Claude loads the agent in those scenarios. Check that the agent provides expected functionality. Use the validation script to catch structural issues."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I use AI to generate my agent configuration?",

        "question": "What colors should I use for different agent types?",
        "answer": "Blue/cyan for analysis and review, green for generation and success-oriented tasks, yellow for validation and caution, red for security and critical tasks, magenta for creative and transformation tasks. Choose distinct colors for agents in the same plugin."
