      "Leaving output format undefined in the system prompt",
      "Granting unnecessary tool access (not following least privilege)",
      "Using underscores or special characters in agent identifiers",
      "Writing system prompts over 10,000 characters (too verbose)",

    "faq": [
      {
        "question": "What's the difference between an agent and a command in Claude Code?",
        "answer": "Agents are autonomous subprocesses that handle complex, multi-step tasks independently and can be triggered automatically based on context. Commands are user-initiated actions that execute when the user explicitly invokes them with slash commands."
      },
      {
        "question": "When should I use 'inherit' vs specific models like 'sonnet' or 'haiku'?",
        "answer": "Use 'inherit' (recommended) to have the agent use the same model as the parent conversation unless the agent needs specific model capabilities. Use 'haiku' for fast, simple tasks, 'sonnet' for balanced performance, and 'opus' for most capable but expensive operations."
      },
      {
        "question": "How many triggering examples should I include in the description?",
        "answer": "Include 2-4 concrete examples covering different scenarios: explicit requests, implicit requests, proactive triggering, and edge cases. More than 6 makes the description too long."
      },
      {
        "question": "What tools should I grant my agent access to?",
        "answer": "Follow the principle of least privilege: grant only the minimum tools needed. For read-only analysis use ['Read', 'Grep', 'Glob'], for code generation use ['Read', 'Write', 'Grep'], and for testing use ['Read', 'Bash', 'Grep']. Omit the tools field only if the agent truly needs full access."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I validate my agent file before deploying?",
        "answer": "Use the validation script: ./scripts/validate-agent.sh agents/your-agent.md. This checks frontmatter structure, required fields, field formats, system prompt presence and length, and example blocks."
      },
      {
        "question": "What makes a good agent identifier?",
        "answer": "Use lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens only. Keep it 3-50 characters, starting and ending with alphanumeric. Be descriptive and specific (code-reviewer, test-generator) rather than generic (helper, agent). Avoid underscores and special characters."
      },
      {
        "question": "Should agents be proactive or only reactive?",
        "answer": "Most effective agents are both: they trigger on explicit user requests (reactive) and also activate automatically when relevant work is completed (proactive). Include examples of both triggering patterns in your description."
      },
      {
        "question": "How long should the system prompt be?",
        "answer": "Aim for 500-3,000 characters (about 1,000-2,000 words) for standard agents. Minimum is 20 characters, but 500+ is recommended. Avoid exceeding 10,000 characters as it becomes too verbose and reduces effectiveness."
