      {
        "question": "When should I create an agent vs a command?",
        "answer": "Agents are for autonomous, multi-step tasks that run independently (code review, test generation, security analysis). Commands are for user-initiated actions triggered explicitly. If the task requires decision-making and multiple tool calls without user input, use an agent."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I make my agent trigger proactively?",
        "answer": "Include examples in the description field showing Claude triggering the agent after relevant work is completed (e.g., after writing code, trigger code-reviewer). Add commentary explaining why proactive triggering is appropriate in that context."
      },
      {
        "question": "What's the best model setting for most agents?",
        "answer": "Use 'inherit' so the agent uses the same model as the parent process. Only specify 'sonnet', 'opus', or 'haiku' if your agent requires specific model capabilities or performance characteristics."
      },
      {
        "question": "How many triggering examples should I include?",
        "answer": "Include 2-4 examples covering explicit requests, proactive triggering, and different phrasings. More than 6 makes the description too long. Focus on the most important triggering scenarios."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I restrict which tools an agent can use?",
        "answer": "Yes, use the 'tools' field in frontmatter with an array of tool names (e.g., [\"Read\", \"Grep\", \"Glob\"] for read-only analysis). If omitted, the agent has access to all tools. Apply principle of least privilege."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I validate my agent file?",
        "answer": "Run './scripts/validate-agent.sh agents/your-agent.md' to check for required fields, correct formats, name constraints, and system prompt structure. The script checks for errors and provides warnings for improvement."
