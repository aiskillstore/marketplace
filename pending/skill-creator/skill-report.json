        "question": "When should I use scripts vs. text instructions?",

      {
        "question": "How do I make my skill trigger at the right time?",

      },
      {
        "question": "What's progressive disclosure and why does it matter?",
        "answer": "Progressive disclosure loads skill content in stages: metadata (always), SKILL.md body (when triggered), bundled resources (as needed). This minimizes context window usage and keeps Claude efficient."

      {
        "question": "Can I create skills without the init_skill.py script?",
