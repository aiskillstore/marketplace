      "Avoid duplication between SKILL.md and reference files - choose one location per piece of information",

    "faq": [
      {
        "question": "What's the difference between scripts, references, and assets?",

      },
      {
        "question": "When should I split content into reference files?",
        "answer": "Split when SKILL.md approaches 500 lines, when supporting multiple frameworks/variants, or when content is only needed for specific use cases. Keep core workflows in SKILL.md and detailed specifications in references."
      },
      {
        "question": "How does the progressive disclosure system work?",
        "answer": "Skills load in three levels: (1) Metadata (name + description) is always in context, (2) SKILL.md body loads when the skill triggers, (3) Bundled resources load only when Claude determines they're needed. This minimizes context usage."
      },
      {
        "question": "What should go in the frontmatter description?",
        "answer": "The description is the primary triggering mechanism. Include what the skill does AND specific contexts/triggers for when to use it. This must be comprehensive since the body isn't loaded until after triggering."
      },
      {
        "question": "Do I need to include all three resource directories?",
        "answer": "No, delete any unneeded directories. The init script creates examples of scripts/, references/, and assets/ to demonstrate structure, but most skills only need one or two of these."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I validate my skill before sharing?",
        "answer": "Run scripts/package_skill.py which automatically validates frontmatter format, naming conventions, structure, and completeness before creating the .skill file. Fix any reported errors and rerun."
