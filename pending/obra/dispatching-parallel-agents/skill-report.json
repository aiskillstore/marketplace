      {
        "question": "What if agents edit the same files?",

        "question": "When should I NOT use this pattern?",

      {
        "question": "How do I verify agent fixes?",
        "answer": "Read each summary, check for conflicting edits, run full test suite, and spot check key functionality. All fixes must work together."
