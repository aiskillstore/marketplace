# Purpose

Execute a raw CLI command.

## Instructions

**REQUIRED STEPS** - Do not skip:

1. **STOP** - Before executing ANY command, you MUST first run the command with the --help flag.

   Example: If the user wants to run `curl google.com`, first run:
   ```
   curl --help
   ```

   If the user wants to run `ffmpeg -i video.mp4 output.gif`, first run:
   ```
   ffmpeg --help
   ```

2. Review the help output to understand available options
3. Only THEN proceed to fork the terminal with the full command

## Red Flags - STOP if you're about to:

- Execute a command without checking its options first
- Assume you know the command syntax
- Skip the --help step "because it's simple"

**STOP** -> Run `<command> --help` first -> Review output -> Then proceed
