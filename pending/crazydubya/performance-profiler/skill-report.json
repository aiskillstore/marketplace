        "question": "What are the limits of pattern-based analysis?",

        "question": "How does this integrate with my IDE?",

      {
        "question": "Is my code data sent anywhere?",

      {
        "question": "Why are my queries slow despite having indexes?",

        "question": "How is this different from profiling tools?",
