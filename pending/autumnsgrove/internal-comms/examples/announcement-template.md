## Template Usage Notes

### When to Use This Template

Use this template for:
- Major organizational changes
- New policies or significant policy updates
- Strategic pivots or major decisions
- Changes affecting most/all employees
- Anything requiring company-wide awareness and action

### Customization Tips

### Best Practices for Announcements

**Timing**:
- Send Tuesday-Thursday, 10am-2pm (not Friday afternoon or Monday morning)

- Consider global time zones for international teams

**Communication Cascade**:
1. Align leadership team first

4. Hold information sessions
5. Follow up with reminders and resources

**Before Sending**:

If longer than this, consider:
