      },
      {
        "question": "Does this skill perform live penetration testing?",
        "answer": "No, this skill provides frameworks and templates for penetration testing workflows but does not execute active exploits."

      {
        "question": "Do I need additional tools for vulnerability scanning?",
        "answer": "Yes, this skill provides the framework and methodology. For active scanning, integrate tools like OWASP ZAP or similar."

      {
        "question": "What is the difference between threat modeling and security auditing?",
        "answer": "Threat modeling is proactive design analysis to identify threats before building. Security auditing reviews existing code for vulnerabilities."
