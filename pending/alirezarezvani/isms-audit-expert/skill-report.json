      {
        "question": "How often should internal ISMS audits be conducted?",
        "answer": "ISO 27001 requires internal audits at planned intervals, typically annually as a minimum. However, risk-based approach should be adopted: high-risk areas and critical security controls should be audited quarterly or semi-annually, while standard processes can be audited annually. New implementations or areas with previous findings may require more frequent audits."

        "question": "What is the difference between Stage 1 and Stage 2 ISO 27001 certification audits?",
        "answer": "Stage 1 is a documentation review focusing on ISMS scope, risk assessment methodology, Statement of Applicability, and overall ISMS framework readiness. Stage 2 is the main certification audit that tests actual implementation and operation of security controls, evaluates ISMS effectiveness, and verifies compliance with ISO 27001 requirements through evidence gathering and on-site assessments."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I integrate penetration testing with ISMS audits?",
        "answer": "Penetration testing should be coordinated as part of technical security control verification during ISMS audits. Plan penetration tests to align with audit schedules for high-risk systems and critical controls. Use penetration test results as evidence of control effectiveness or to identify control gaps. Ensure penetration testing scope covers key security domains like network security, access controls, and application security aligned with ISO 27002 control objectives."

      {
        "question": "What technical competencies should ISMS auditors possess?",
        "answer": "ISMS auditors should have knowledge of network security protocols, system hardening, application security testing, cryptography implementation, and security architecture. They need skills in vulnerability assessment, security control testing, risk assessment, and compliance frameworks. ISO 27001/27002 expertise is essential, along with audit methodology proficiency and the ability to communicate technical findings to both technical and executive audiences."

        "question": "How do I prepare for cloud security audits in ISO 27001 context?",
        "answer": "Cloud security audits should verify CSP security certifications (ISO 27001, SOC 2), assess shared responsibility model implementation, review cloud resource configurations against security baselines, evaluate data encryption and key management, and test cloud identity and access management controls. Use cloud-native security tools for configuration assessment and ensure audit scope covers both CSP-managed and customer-managed security controls."
