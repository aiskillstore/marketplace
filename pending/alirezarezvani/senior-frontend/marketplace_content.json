    "faq": [
      {"question": "What React versions are supported?", "answer": "Supports React 18 and newer with hooks-based patterns. Works with Next.js 13+ App Router."},
      {"question": "Does this skill modify my code?", "answer": "It generates new files and suggests improvements. All modifications require explicit user approval before execution."},
      {"question": "Can I customize component templates?", "answer": "Yes, templates are configurable through script options. Custom templates can be added to the references directory."},
      {"question": "What styling approaches are supported?", "answer": "Tailwind CSS is primary. Can generate CSS Modules, styled-components, or plain CSS on request."},
      {"question": "Does this work with React Native?", "answer": "Core patterns apply. Use the component generator with React Native project structure for mobile development."},
      {"question": "How does bundle analysis work?", "answer": "Scans build output to report chunk sizes, identifies large dependencies, and suggests optimization strategies."}
