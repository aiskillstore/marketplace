    "faq": [
      {"question": "What programming languages does this skill support?", "answer": "The skill supports Node.js, Express, Python, Go, TypeScript, JavaScript, Kotlin, and Swift for backend development."},
      {"question": "Can I use this skill with cloud databases?", "answer": "Yes, the database tools work with PostgreSQL, NeonDB, Supabase, and other PostgreSQL-compatible cloud providers."},
      {"question": "Does the load tester actually send requests?", "answer": "The load tester analyzes API structure and generates load testing configurations and reports, but does not execute external requests."},
      {"question": "How do I customize the generated API scaffolding?", "answer": "Pass options to the api_scaffolder.py script or modify the generated template files before deployment."},
      {"question": "Is the skill suitable for microservices architecture?", "answer": "Yes, the patterns and tools support both monolithic and microservices architectures with container deployment guidance."},
      {"question": "Does this skill handle authentication implementation?", "answer": "The skill provides authentication patterns and scaffolding templates, but actual implementation requires customization for your specific requirements."}
