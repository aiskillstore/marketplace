      {

      },
      {
        "question": "Can I skip stages or modify the workflow?",
        "answer": "Yes, you have full agency to adjust the process. If a stage doesn't make sense for your document, you can skip it or work freeform. The workflow is a guide, not a requirement."
      },
      {
        "question": "What if I don't have integrations enabled for Slack or Google Drive?",
        "answer": "You can still use the workflow - just paste relevant content directly into the chat instead of pulling it from connected tools. In claude.ai or the Claude app, you can enable connectors in settings to allow direct integration access."
      },
      {
        "question": "How does reader testing work?",
        "answer": "In environments like Claude Code, reader testing uses a fresh Claude instance with no context from your conversation to answer questions about your doc. In other environments like claude.ai, you'll manually test by opening a new conversation and asking the questions."
      },
      {
        "question": "Should I use artifacts or files?",
        "answer": "The workflow automatically adapts - it uses artifacts if available (like in claude.ai) or creates markdown files in environments without artifacts (like Claude Code). Both approaches work equally well."
      },
      {
        "question": "How long does this workflow typically take?",
        "answer": "It depends on document complexity and how much context needs to be gathered. The workflow prioritizes quality over speed - the goal is a document that actually works for readers, which saves time in the long run by reducing confusion and follow-up questions."
