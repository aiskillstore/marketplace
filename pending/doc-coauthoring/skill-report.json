    "faq": [
      {
        "question": "How long does the full workflow take?",
        "answer": "The workflow is thorough and takes longer than freeform writing, but ensures higher quality output. The time varies based on document complexity - a simple decision doc might take 30-60 minutes, while a comprehensive technical spec could take 2-3 hours. The investment pays off by catching issues before others read the document."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I skip stages if I'm in a hurry?",
        "answer": "Yes, you have full agency to adjust the process. If you want to skip stages or work freeform, just let Claude know. However, skipping context gathering or reader testing often leads to documents that confuse readers and require more revisions later."
      },
      {
        "question": "What if I don't have integrations set up for Slack or Google Docs?",
        "answer": "The workflow works fine without integrations - you can paste content directly or provide summaries of relevant discussions and documents. Claude will suggest enabling connectors if available, but it's not required."
      },
      {
        "question": "How does reader testing work?",
        "answer": "In Claude Code, reader testing happens automatically with sub-agents. In claude.ai, you'll open a fresh conversation and test the document yourself by asking predicted reader questions. This simulates how others will understand the doc without your context."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I use my own document template?",
        "answer": "Absolutely. During context gathering, you can share your template and Claude will structure the workflow around it, creating sections based on your template's structure."
      },
      {
        "question": "What's the difference between artifacts and markdown files?",
        "answer": "In environments with artifact support (like claude.ai), Claude creates an interactive artifact you can view and download. In Claude Code or terminal environments, it creates a markdown file in your working directory. Both approaches support the same iterative refinement workflow."
