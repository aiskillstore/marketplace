    "best_practices": [
      "Accept the structured workflow when offered - it catches blind spots that freeform writing often misses",

      "Use shorthand when answering questions (e.g., '1: yes, 2: see #channel, 3: no because backwards compat') to save time",
      "Start with sections having the most unknowns (usually core proposal/decision) rather than introductions",
      "Indicate what to change rather than editing the document directly - this helps Claude learn your style for future sections",
      "Enable MCP connectors (Slack, Google Drive, etc.) before starting to allow direct context pulling",
      "Be specific about what to keep/remove/combine when curating brainstormed options",
      "Complete Reader Testing even if the doc seems done - it frequently catches clarity issues authors miss",
      "Request alt-text generation for images in shared documents to ensure AI accessibility",
      "Link the conversation in an appendix so readers can see development context if needed"
    ],
    "anti_patterns": [
      "Skipping Context Gathering stage - leads to generic content that doesn't address specific organizational needs",
      "Editing the document directly instead of telling Claude what to change - prevents style learning across sections",
      "Starting with summary/introduction sections - these are better written last when core content is finalized",
      "Accepting 'good enough' during refinement without asking if anything can be removed - leads to bloated docs",
      "Skipping Reader Testing - authors often overestimate how clear their writing is to fresh readers",
      "Providing only high-level feedback like 'looks good' - specific feedback improves later sections",
      "Rushing through brainstorming by selecting everything - curation is where quality emerges",
      "Working freeform when the document is substantial - structured workflow ensures completeness and reader clarity"
    ],
    "faq": [
      {
        "question": "How long does this workflow typically take?",
        "answer": "The workflow is intentionally thorough and time-intensive. A substantial technical spec or PRD might take 1-3 hours depending on complexity and available context. The time investment pays off by producing documentation that readers can actually understand without asking clarifying questions."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I use this for short documents like one-pagers?",
        "answer": "While you can use this workflow for any document, it's optimized for substantial documentation like technical specs, PRDs, and decision docs. For simple one-pagers, freeform writing might be more efficient."
      },
      {
        "question": "What if I don't have access to Slack/Google Drive integrations?",
        "answer": "The workflow still works - you'll just paste context directly instead of Claude pulling it automatically. You can enable MCP connectors in Claude settings to add these integrations."
      },
      {
        "question": "How does Reader Testing work without sub-agents?",
        "answer": "In environments without sub-agent access (like claude.ai web), you manually test by opening a fresh Claude conversation, pasting the document, and asking the generated questions to see if Reader Claude understands correctly."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I skip stages if I'm in a hurry?",
        "answer": "Yes - Claude will offer to let you work freeform if you want to skip stages. However, each stage serves a purpose: Context Gathering prevents generic content, Refinement ensures quality, and Reader Testing catches blind spots that waste readers' time later."
      },
      {
        "question": "What document types work best with this workflow?",
        "answer": "PRDs, technical specs, design docs, decision docs (RFCs), project proposals, and any substantial documentation meant to be read and understood by others without additional context."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why use artifacts or files instead of just conversational output?",
        "answer": "Having a persistent document scaffold allows both you and Claude to reference and edit specific sections surgically (using str_replace) rather than rewriting entire documents. This preserves context and enables precise refinements."
      },
      {
        "question": "What if Reader Claude passes but real readers still have questions?",
        "answer": "Reader Testing catches common comprehension issues but isn't perfect. Real reader feedback is valuable - update the document based on actual questions received and consider those patterns for future docs."
