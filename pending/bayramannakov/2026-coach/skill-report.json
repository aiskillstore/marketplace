      "Complete the full discovery phase before setting goals. The skill needs to understand your constraints, available time, and current stage to create effective process goals.",
      "Be honest about your time availability. Process goals must be achievable within your actual schedule, not an idealized version.",

    ],
    "anti_patterns": [
      "Setting process goals that depend on others. Process goals must be 100% within your control, like sending messages rather than getting replies.",
      "Skipping the weekly review. Without regular reflection, you lose visibility into whether your process goals are driving real progress.",

      {
        "question": "Does this skill work with Claude Code and Claude.ai?",

      },
      {
        "question": "How many process goals should I set?",
        "answer": "Research suggests focusing on 3-5 daily process goals maximum. Each should be an activity you control 100% and can complete regardless of external factors."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I integrate this with other tools?",

      {
        "question": "Is my data safe with this skill?",
        "answer": "Yes. This is a prompt-only skill. It has no file access, network calls, or code execution. All planning data stays in your conversation or files you explicitly create."
      },
      {
        "question": "What if I miss my daily targets?",
        "answer": "Missing process goals is data, not failure. Use weekly reviews to identify barriers and adjust goals. The skill helps you troubleshoot without judgment and refocus on controllable actions."

      {
        "question": "How is this different from other goal-setting methods?",
