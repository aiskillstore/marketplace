    "faq": [
      {
        "question": "What causes keyboard navigation to fail with CSS animations?",

      },
      {
        "question": "How long should the retry delays be?",
        "answer": "Use 20ms intervals with 5 attempts (100ms total). This allows most animations to progress past opacity:0 without adding noticeable lag."
      },
      {
        "question": "Does this work with all animation types?",
        "answer": "Yes. The retry mechanism works with any animation duration because it checks actual focus success rather than using fixed delays."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is user data collected or transmitted?",
        "answer": "No. This documentation-only skill contains no code that accesses, collects, or transmits user data."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why check document.activeElement instead of focus() return value?",
        "answer": "focus() returns true/false inconsistently across browsers. Checking document.activeElement reliably confirms focus moved to the target element."
      },
      {
        "question": "How does this compare to other UI libraries?",
        "answer": "This pattern is similar to how bits-ui handles animated presence in Svelte. The retry mechanism is a general approach that works across frameworks."
