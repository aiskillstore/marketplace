      },
      {
        "question": "How does patch staging work?",
        "answer": "Patch staging (git add -p) allows you to review each change hunk in a file and decide whether to stage it, skip it, or split it further. This enables creating separate commits for different changes within the same file."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I use this skill without Conventional Commits?",
        "answer": "Conventional Commits are required by default, but you can ask for a different format. The skill will still follow the same workflow of staging, reviewing, and verifying changes."
      },
      {
        "question": "What checks are run before committing?",
        "answer": "The skill prompts you to run the fastest meaningful check for your project, such as unit tests, linting, or a build command. The specific check depends on your project setup."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I handle merge conflicts with this skill?",
        "answer": "This skill focuses on commit creation, not conflict resolution. For merge conflicts, resolve them first using standard git merge tools, then use this skill to create clean commits."
