If angry, wait 24 hours.\n\n**Phase 2: Delivery - Suggested Opening**\n\n\"I wanted to check in about the recent deliverables. I've noticed the last three have come in past deadline, and I'd like to understand what's happening from your end and how we can address it together.\"\n\n**Phase 3: Follow-up**\n\nDocument what you agree on and schedule a check-in for two weeks."

Write down your thoughts but don't send them.\n\n**When you're ready, here's an opening:**\n\"I'd like to talk about what happened in yesterday's meeting.

    ],
    "faq": [
      {
        "question": "How long should I wait before having a difficult conversation?",
        "answer": "Address issues promptly but not when emotional. For anger, wait 24 hours. For anxiety, practice first. For hurt, talk to a neutral party. The key is being calm enough to listen and respond thoughtfully rather than react."
      },
      {
        "question": "What if the other person gets defensive or shuts down?",
        "answer": "Defensiveness is normal. Acknowledge it without backing down: 'I can see this is uncomfortable.' If they shut down, pause and ask what would help them engage. If they attack, stay calm and return to facts. The skill includes specific response phrases for each defensive pattern."
      },
      {
        "question": "Should I document the conversation?",
        "answer": "Document agreements, not accusations. Send a brief follow-up email summarizing what was agreed, who does what by when, and when you'll check in. This protects both parties and ensures alignment. Don't document every word or use it as evidence."
      },
      {
        "question": "When should I escalate to HR or my manager?",
        "answer": "Escalate when safety is at risk, legal issues are involved, repeated conversations haven't worked, power dynamics prevent honest discussion, or you need formal documentation. The skill helps you try resolution first, but some situations require immediate escalation."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I handle my own emotions during the conversation?",
        "answer": "Watch for early warning signs: racing heart, shallow breathing, rehearsing rebuttals. Use the pause technique: 'Let me think about that.' Take a breath. Speak slower. Remember your positive intention. If triggered, ask for a short break. The skill includes pre-conversation rituals to help you enter calm."
      },
      {
        "question": "What makes a difficult conversation successful?",
        "answer": "Success means both parties feel heard, specific actions are agreed upon, the relationship is preserved or improved, the issue has a clear resolution path, and neither party is blindsided later. It's not about 'winning' - it's about understanding and moving forward together."
