        "question": "What is the difference between sandbox modes?",
        "answer": "Read-only limits access to viewing files. Workspace-write permits creating and modifying files in a sandbox. Danger-full-access allows broad system access. Use read-only for analysis by default."

      {
        "question": "How do I resume a Codex session?",
        "answer": "Simply say 'codex resume' or ask to continue with the previous session. Claude will use 'codex exec resume --last' with the same model and settings from the original session."
      },
      {
        "question": "What reasoning effort should I use?",
        "answer": "Xhigh for ultra-complex problems requiring deep analysis. High for refactoring, security reviews, and performance optimization. Medium for standard coding tasks. Low for quick fixes and formatting."
      },
      {
        "question": "How does the skill handle thinking tokens?",
        "answer": "By default, thinking tokens (stderr) are suppressed to save context window space. Ask to see thinking tokens if you need visibility into Codex's internal reasoning process."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I switch models mid-session?",
        "answer": "Within a Codex session, use the /model slash command to switch models. Between sessions, specify the model in your prompt. The skill defaults to gpt-5.2."
