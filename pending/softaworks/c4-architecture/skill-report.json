    "faq": [
      {
        "question": "What is the C4 model?",
        "answer": "The C4 model is a simple visual language for describing software architecture. It has four levels: Context (system scope), Container (deployable units), Component (internal structure), and Code (implementation details). Most teams only need the first two levels."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I view the generated diagrams?",
        "answer": "The skill generates Mermaid syntax in markdown files. You can view these in any tool that supports Mermaid: GitHub, GitLab, VS Code with extensions, or the Mermaid Live Editor online."
      },
      {
        "question": "Which diagram level should I use?",
        "answer": "Use Context diagrams for executives and non-technical stakeholders. Use Container diagrams for technical teams. Component diagrams are only needed when internal structure adds value. Deployment diagrams are for DevOps and infrastructure discussions."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I customize the diagram styling?",
        "answer": "Yes. The skill supports Mermaid C4 styling functions like UpdateElementStyle and UpdateRelStyle. You can customize colors, fonts, and relationship offsets to improve readability."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I document microservices?",
        "answer": "For single-team ownership, model microservices as containers within a system boundary. For multi-team ownership, promote each microservice to a system in the Context diagram. Always show databases and message queues as separate containers."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is a Dynamic diagram?",
        "answer": "Dynamic diagrams show runtime behavior with numbered steps. Use them to document request flows, transaction processing, or event propagation through your system. They help explain complex interactions that static diagrams cannot capture."
