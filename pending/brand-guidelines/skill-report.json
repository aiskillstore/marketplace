        "question": "Can I use these colors in web design?",
        "answer": "Yes. The RGB color values provided (#141413, #faf9f5, etc.) work across web, print, and digital formats. For web, convert to hex format (#141413) or use the RGB equivalents."

      {
        "question": "What if I need to modify the colors slightly?",
