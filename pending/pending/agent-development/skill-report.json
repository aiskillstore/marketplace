    "faq": [
      {
        "question": "What's the difference between an agent and a command in Claude Code plugins?",
        "answer": "Agents are autonomous subprocesses that handle complex, multi-step tasks independently and can be triggered proactively by Claude. Commands are user-initiated actions that execute when explicitly called. Agents are for autonomous work, commands are for user-initiated actions."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I make an agent trigger proactively without user request?",
        "answer": "Include examples in the description field that show the agent triggering after relevant work. For instance, a code-review agent should have an example where after the user writes code, the assistant proactively says 'Let me review this code' and triggers the agent. The commentary should explain this proactive triggering."
      },
      {
        "question": "Should I use 'inherit', 'sonnet', 'opus', or 'haiku' for the model field?",
        "answer": "Use 'inherit' (recommended) unless the agent needs specific model capabilities. This makes the agent use the same model as the parent context. Only specify sonnet/opus/haiku if you need particular performance characteristics."
      },
      {
        "question": "How many triggering examples should I include in the description?",
        "answer": "Include 2-4 concrete examples. At minimum, cover an explicit request and one proactive trigger. Recommended is 3-4 examples covering explicit request, implicit request, proactive trigger, and an edge case."
      },
      {
        "question": "What tools should I grant to my agent?",
        "answer": "Only grant the minimum tools needed. Read-only analysis agents typically need ['Read', 'Grep', 'Glob']. Code generation agents need ['Read', 'Write', 'Grep']. Testing agents need ['Read', 'Bash', 'Grep']. Omit the tools field only if the agent truly needs access to all tools."
      },
      {
        "question": "How long should the system prompt be?",
        "answer": "Aim for 500-3,000 characters for standard agents. Minimum viable is ~500 words with role, responsibilities, process, and output format. Avoid exceeding 10,000 characters as effectiveness diminishes."
      },
      {
        "question": "What does the validation script check?",
        "answer": "The validate-agent.sh script checks: file exists, YAML frontmatter structure, required fields (name, description, model, color), field format constraints, identifier length and pattern, system prompt presence and length, example blocks in description, and provides warnings for generic names or missing best practices."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I use AI to generate agents instead of writing them manually?",
        "answer": "Yes! The skill includes the exact system prompt used by Claude Code's agent generation feature. Send Claude a description of what you want the agent to do along with the agent-creation-system-prompt, and it will return JSON with identifier, whenToUse, and systemPrompt that you can convert to an agent file."
