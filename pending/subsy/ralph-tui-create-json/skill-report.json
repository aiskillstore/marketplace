    "faq": [
      {
        "question": "What is ralph-tui and how does it use the prd.json file?",
        "answer": "Ralph-tui is a tool that runs AI agents to implement software features autonomously. It reads the prd.json file, selects the highest-priority story with no blocking dependencies, and spawns an AI agent to implement it. Once complete, it marks the story as passed and continues to the next."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why must the JSON be flat with fields at the root level?",
        "answer": "Ralph-tui expects a specific schema where 'name' and 'userStories' are top-level fields. Wrapping them in a 'prd' object or using different field names will cause validation errors when ralph-tui tries to load the file."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I determine the right size for a user story?",
        "answer": "Each story should be completable in one ralph-tui iteration (roughly one AI context window). A good rule of thumb is that if you cannot describe the change in 2-3 sentences, it is too big. Examples of right-sized stories: add a database column with migration, add a UI component to an existing page, or update a server action with new logic."
      },
      {
        "question": "What should I do if my PRD does not have a Quality Gates section?",
        "answer": "Ask the user what commands should pass for each story, or use sensible defaults like `npm run typecheck` and `npm run lint`. Quality gates ensure that every story meets minimum quality standards before being marked complete."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do dependencies work in the dependsOn array?",
        "answer": "The dependsOn array contains story IDs that must be completed before the current story can be worked on. Ralph-tui will show dependent stories as blocked until their prerequisites are marked as passed. This ensures proper implementation order, such as creating database schemas before UI components that use them."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I use this skill with tools other than ralph-tui?",
        "answer": "While the output format is specifically designed for ralph-tui, the structured JSON can be adapted for other tools. However, the field names and flat structure are optimized for ralph-tui's requirements and may need modification for other systems."
