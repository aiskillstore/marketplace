## 1. FUNDAMENTALS

### Why Email Wins
- ROI: $36 per $1 spent (3,600%). Newsletter-as-business: 122%. Social: 28%. Paid search: 25%.
- 89% of marketers use email as primary lead gen channel. 51% of consumers prefer email from brands.
- Email is owned media — no algorithm throttling, no platform risk.
- Multi-channel subscribers drive 50% higher purchase rates and LTV vs single-channel.

### The Email Stack (6 components)
1. **ESP** — sending platform (Klaviyo, Mailchimp, etc.). See Section 12.
2. **Authentication** — SPF, DKIM, DMARC. Non-negotiable since Feb 2024 Google/Yahoo rules.
3. **List management** — quality > size. 5K engaged beats 50K messy.
4. **Content & design** — 60%+ opens on mobile. Mobile-first is essential.
5. **Automation** — flows generate 30x more RPR than campaigns. Set up flows before campaigns.
6. **Analytics** — 21% of marketers don't measure ROI. Don't be one of them.

### Key Metrics & Benchmarks

| Metric | Good | Strong | Red Flag |
|---|---|---|---|
| Click-through rate | 2-3% | 4%+ | Below 1% |
| Click-to-open rate | 10-15% | 20%+ | Below 5% |
| Unsubscribe rate | Under 0.2% | Under 0.1% | Above 0.5% |
| Bounce rate | Under 2% | Under 1% | Above 3% |
| Spam complaint rate | Under 0.1% | Under 0.05% | Above 0.3% |
| List growth rate | 3-5%/month | 5%+/month | Negative |
| Delivery rate | 95%+ | 98%+ | Below 85% |
| Inbox placement | 85-94% | 94%+ | Below 70% |

**Post-Apple MPP:** Open rates are directional only. Use click-based metrics as primary.

### Tags vs Segments vs Lists
- **Lists:** Use ONE master list. Multiple lists = duplicate subscribers, inconsistent data.
- **Tags:** Labels on subscribers (facts). Applied manually or via automation.
- **Segments:** Dynamic groups based on rules. Auto-update as conditions change.
- Minimum segments: new (last 30 days), engaged (clicked last 60 days), customers vs non-customers, lapsed (90+ days).

## 2. LIST BUILDING

### Organic Growth
- **Lead magnets:** Templates/swipe files convert highest. Free template increased signups by 384%.
- **Content upgrades:** 5-10x better opt-in vs generic sidebar forms.
- **Signup forms:** Form > link (20-50% more opt-ins). "Get my templates" > "Subscribe" (33% lift).

### Popups
- Well-timed popups: 3-5% conversion. Top 10%: 9.28%.
- Exit-intent: 4-7%. Two-step popups: 30-50% better than single-step.

### Double vs Single Opt-in
- Double opt-in recommended for most. Validates addresses, prevents bots/traps, GDPR-ready.
- Compromise: single opt-in for purchasers, double for lead magnets/popups.

### List Hygiene & Spam Traps
- Lists decay 22-30% annually. Unengaged subscribers cost money AND hurt deliverability.
- **Sunset flow:** Reduce frequency → re-engagement series (2-3 emails) → suppress non-responders.
- **Spam traps:** Pristine (honeypots), recycled (abandoned addresses), typo (gnail.com), role-based (info@).
- **Prevention:** Double opt-in, real-time validation at signup, regular list cleaning, engagement-based sending.

## 3. SEGMENTATION & PERSONALISATION

### Personalisation Hierarchy (most to least impactful)
1. **Behavioural:** Product recs from browse/purchase history. Highest impact.
2. **Lifecycle:** Different content for new, active, VIP, at-risk, lapsed.
3. **Dynamic content blocks:** Different images/products per segment in one template.
4. **Send-time:** Per-subscriber optimal timing.
5. **Location-based:** Weather, events, timezone, nearby stores.
6. **Name/demographic:** Fine as addition, not meaningful alone.

### RFM Quick Start
Simple version: segment by recency of last purchase into 4 groups:
1. Purchased last 30 days (active)
2. 31-90 days ago (warm)
3. 91-180 days ago (cooling)
4. 180+ days ago (cold)

### Engagement-Based Sending (highest-impact optimisation)
- **Tier 1:** Clicked last 30 days → every campaign
- **Tier 2:** Clicked last 60 days → 75% of sends
- **Tier 3:** Clicked last 90 days → best content only (50%)
- **Tier 4:** No engagement 90-180 days → re-engagement flow only
- **Tier 5:** 180+ days → sunset flow
- Results: 15-30% better open rates, 20-40% fewer complaints, revenue stays flat or increases.

### Waterfall Segmentation (prevents "three emails in one day")
Priority: Abandoned cart → Post-purchase → Browse abandonment → Win-back → Promotional.

## 4. AUTOMATION FLOWS (Revenue Engines)

### Automations vs Campaigns

| Metric | Automations | Campaigns |
|---|---|---|
| Revenue per recipient | 30x higher | Baseline |
| Open rate | 40-55% | 15-25% |
| Click rate | 5-10% | 2-3% |

### Flow Priority Order (by revenue impact per setup hour)
1. Welcome series → 2. Abandoned cart → 3. Browse abandonment → 4. Post-purchase → 5. Win-back → 6. Cross-sell/upsell → 7. VIP/loyalty → 8. Sunset → 9. Birthday → 10. Replenishment → 11. Back-in-stock → 12. Price drop

### Welcome Series (4-6 emails, 1-2 weeks)
- Open rate: 51-55%. Revenue: 320% more per email vs promotional.
- **Email 1 (immediate):** Deliver promise + ask for reply + one segmentation question.
- **Email 2 (Day 2):** Brand story.
- **Email 3 (Day 4):** Social proof.
- **Email 4 (Day 7):** Best content/product using segmentation data.
- **Email 5 (Day 10):** Soft sell.
- **Email 6 (Day 14):** Set expectations + preference centre link.

### Abandoned Cart (3 emails)
- 70% of carts abandoned. Recovery: 17.12% conversion. Top 10%: $3.07 RPR.
- **Email 1 (1-4h):** Simple reminder. NO discount.
- **Email 2 (24h):** Address objections. Reviews, shipping, guarantee.
- **Email 3 (48h):** Small incentive if margins allow. First-time abandoners only.

### Post-Purchase Sequence
Immediately: Order confirmation → Day 2-3: Shipping → Day 7-10: Satisfaction check → Day 14: Review request → Day 21-30: Cross-sell → Day 25-30: Replenishment (consumables).

### Win-Back (target 60-90 day inactive)
1. "We miss you" → 2. Value offer → 3. Breakup email (highest reply rate) → 4. Confirmation + re-subscribe link.

## 5. COPYWRITING

### Subject Lines
- 64% decide to open based on subject line. Under 25 chars = highest opens.
- Personalisation: +14% opens. First-person CTA > second-person (25-35% lift).

### Body Copy
- Inverted pyramid: key message first. Short paragraphs. Write, then cut 30%.
- 3:1 ratio: three value emails per one promotional.

### Copywriting Frameworks
- **AIDA:** Attention → Interest → Desire → Action. Best for promotional.
- **PAS:** Problem → Agitate → Solution. Best for cold email, B2B.
- **BAB:** Before → After → Bridge. Best for case studies.
- **Soap Opera Sequence (Chaperon):** Multi-email narrative. 70%+ open rates deep in sequence.
- **1-3-1 Newsletter:** One big story + three shorter items + one CTA.

### CTAs
- Buttons > text links (+27% CTR). Single CTA: +42% clicks vs multiple.
- Place CTA above fold AND below main content (+35% total clicks).

## 7. DELIVERABILITY

### Authentication (all three required)
- **SPF:** DNS TXT record listing authorised sending IPs. 10 DNS lookup limit. End with `-all`.
- **DKIM:** 2048-bit RSA keys. Rotate annually. `d=` domain must align with From address.
- **DMARC:** Implement in stages: `p=none` → `p=quarantine` → `p=reject`.
- **BIMI:** Brand logo in inbox. Requires DMARC enforcement + VMC (~$1,500/year).
- **Order:** SPF → DKIM → DMARC (p=none) → advance DMARC → BIMI.

### Sender Reputation
- Domain reputation > IP reputation for Gmail (120-day window).
- Dedicated IP: only if sending 1M+/month. Below that, shared IPs are fine.

### Sending Identity
- Separate marketing from transactional: different subdomains. Worth it at 40K+/month.
- From name: personal names get +3.81% opens. Always set monitored reply-to.

### Deliverability Diagnosis (10-step framework)
1. Identify symptom → 2. Check authentication → 3. Check blocklists → 4. Check reputation → 5. Analyse bounce logs → 6. Review sending patterns → 7. Check content → 8. Test and validate → 9. Remediate root cause → 10. Monitor recovery (2-4 weeks, Gmail up to 120 days).

### Domain/IP Warming
Days 1-3: 50-100 → Days 4-7: 200-500 → Week 2: 500-1K → Week 3: 1-5K → Week 4: 5-10K → Week 5+: Scale to full. Start with most engaged subscribers.

- Only 1 in 7 tests produces significant winner. Use 95% confidence calculator.
- Prioritise testing automated flows over campaigns (flow improvements compound indefinitely).
- STO: 5-15% improvement in open rates. Per-subscriber timing.

## 13. COLD EMAIL

### Infrastructure (critical)
- **NEVER send from primary domain.** Buy 3-5 separate domains. Warm 2-4 weeks.
- Limit: 10-30 emails per inbox per day. Use dedicated cold email tool (NOT marketing ESP).

### Writing Cold Emails
- **Optimal length: 50-125 words.** Personalised opening → problem/observation → value prop → soft CTA.
- Interest-based CTAs: 2-3x more replies than meeting requests.

### Personalisation Levels
| Level | Reply Rate | Scale |
|---|---|---|
| Hyper-personalised (5+ min) | 15-25% | 20-30/day |
| Semi-personalised (1-2 min) | 8-15% | 50-100/day |
| Segmented (template/segment) | 3-8% | 100s/day |

### Follow-Up
4 emails over 2-3 weeks. Each MUST add new value. Breakup email = 2-3x reply rate of mid-sequence.

## 14. AI & EMAIL

### Where AI Excels
- Subject lines (80% comparable to human, 10% of time), send-time optimisation (10-25% lift), segmentation/churn prediction, first drafts.

### Where AI Falls Short
- Brand voice consistency, strategic decisions, emotional nuance, creative breakthroughs.

### Human-AI Workflow
1. Brief AI with context → 2. Generate draft → 3. Edit for brand voice → 4. A/B test → 5. Feed results back.

### MCP Integration
- Model Context Protocol enables AI to interact with email platforms through natural language.
- Bento offers MCP server integration for managing email from within developer tools.
