      {

      {
        "question": "Can I use React Email with email providers other than Resend?",
        "answer": "Yes. React Email works with any email service provider. Render your template to HTML using the render() function, then pass the HTML to your provider's send API. Supported providers include SendGrid, Mailgun, AWS SES, and Postmark."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I handle images in emails?",
        "answer": "Place images in the static folder within your emails directory. Use the Img component with absolute URLs. For development, images are served from the dev server. For production, use a CDN URL. Always include alt text and avoid SVG/WEBP formats."
      },
      {
        "question": "What CSS properties are supported in email clients?",
        "answer": "Email clients have limited CSS support. Use inline styles or Tailwind utility classes. Avoid flexbox, grid, position: absolute, and media queries. Use table-based layouts for complex structures. Reference caniemail.com for specific property support."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I send emails with dynamic content?",
        "answer": "Pass dynamic values as props to your email component. Use the render() function to convert the component to HTML with those props applied. Example: await render(<WelcomeEmail name={user.name} />)."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is the recommended email width for responsive design?",
        "answer": "Use a maximum width of 600px for optimal readability across desktop and mobile email clients. Test on mobile devices to ensure content remains accessible and properly formatted at smaller screen sizes."
