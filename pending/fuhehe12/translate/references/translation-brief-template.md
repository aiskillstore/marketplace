## Translation Tone

> The core output of the reconstruction phase. This is not a checklist to fill out casually — it is a considered judgment distilled from a full read-through, drawn from the "imaginative space" you build in your mind.

### Imaginative Space

`[Describe in one paragraph (3–5 sentences) the overall mental space you inhabit after reading. Not a list of traits — an immersive rendering: Where are you standing? What does the scene look like? Who is speaking, to whom, and what is their relationship? What is the atmosphere? Example: "An experienced engineer sits across from you, slides a cup of coffee over, and says, 'Let me tell you what's really wrong with this thing.' He's seen too much to be shocked, so there's a dry humor to it — but every point lands like a nail: direct, precise, no filler. When you're done reading, it feels like you just sat in on a candid private debrief you can actually trust."]`
