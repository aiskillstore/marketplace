Auto-invokes when the user wants to create, update, modify, enhance, validate, or standardize slash commands, or when modifying command YAML frontmatter fields (especially 'model', 'allowed-tools', 'description'), needs help designing command workflows, or wants to understand command arguments and parameters. Also auto-invokes proactively when Claude is about to write command files (*/commands/*.md), or implement tasks that involve creating slash command components.",
