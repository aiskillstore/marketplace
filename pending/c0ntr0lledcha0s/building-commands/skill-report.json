        "question": "Can I use this skill for project-level commands?",

        "question": "Is the validation script safe to run?",

      {
        "question": "Why does my command fail with model not found?",
        "answer": "Commands use short aliases differently than agents. Change model: haiku to model: claude-haiku-4-5 or remove the model field entirely to inherit from conversation."

      {
        "question": "How is this different from building agents?",
