      {
        "question": "Is data sent to external services?",

      {
        "question": "Why is my project not activating this skill?",
        "answer": "Mention keywords like roadmap, resource allocation, multiple projects, cross-project dependencies, or OKRs. The skill activates on these triggers."

      {
        "question": "How does this differ from sprint planning skills?",
        "answer": "Sprint planning focuses on 1-2 week execution within a single project. This skill coordinates across multiple projects over months with strategic alignment."
