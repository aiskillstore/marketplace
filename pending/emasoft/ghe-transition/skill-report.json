This is a PHASE CHANGE operation, not just saving progress.\n\nUSE THIS SKILL WHEN:\n- User says \"transition to TEST\" or \"move to REVIEW\"\n- User says \"I'm done with DEV, start TEST\" or \"DEV complete\"\n- User says \"advance to next phase\" or \"close this phase\"\n- User says \"demote to DEV\" (from TEST or REVIEW)\n- User says \"tests pass, ready for review\"\n- User says \"merge this\" (after REVIEW PASS)\n- User explicitly wants to END current phase and BEGIN next\n\nDO NOT USE THIS SKILL WHEN:\n- User just wants to SEE status (use ghe-status)\n- User wants to START work on new issue (use ghe-claim)\n- User wants to SAVE progress but CONTINUE working (use ghe-checkpoint)\n- User wants reports (use ghe-report)\n- User is not ready to END current phase\n\nIMPORTANT: This CLOSES current thread and OPENS next thread. Use ghe-checkpoint if you just want to save progress without changing phases.\n\nEXAMPLES:\n<example>\nContext: DEV work complete, ready for testing\nuser: \"I'm done with DEV, transition to TEST\"\nassistant: \"I'll use ghe-transition to close DEV and open TEST thread\"\n</example>\n<example>\nContext: All tests pass, ready for review\nuser: \"Tests pass, move to REVIEW\"\nassistant: \"I'll use ghe-transition to close TEST and open REVIEW thread\"\n</example>\n<example>\nContext: Structural issues found in TEST\nuser: \"This needs structural changes, demote to DEV\"\nassistant: \"I'll use ghe-transition to demote from TEST back to DEV\"\n</example>\n<example>\nContext: REVIEW passed, ready to merge\nuser: \"REVIEW passed, merge it\"\nassistant: \"I'll use ghe-transition to complete the workflow and merge\"\n</example>\n",
