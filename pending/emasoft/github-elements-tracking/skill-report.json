      {
        "question": "What are the three phases?",
        "answer": "DEV phase is for development and test writing. TEST phase is for running tests and fixing bugs only. REVIEW phase is for quality evaluation and pass/fail verdicts. Phases must follow the strict order: DEV → TEST → REVIEW → (repeat or complete)."
      },
      {
        "question": "How does SERENA MCP integration work?",
        "answer": "SERENA MCP stores large documents that exceed GitHub limits. The skill maintains references in the GitHub Issue thread while the actual content lives in SERENA memory bank. This enables tracking of large documents without fragmenting the issue history."
