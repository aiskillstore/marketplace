      {
        "question": "What transport should I choose for my MCP server?",
        "answer": "Use stdio for local integrations and development tools. Use streamable HTTP for remote servers that serve multiple clients. SSE is deprecated in favor of streamable HTTP."

      {
        "question": "How do I secure my MCP server authentication?",
        "answer": "Store API keys in environment variables only. Never hardcode credentials. Validate tokens on startup. Use OAuth 2.1 for services that support it. Provide clear error messages without exposing internal details."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is my data safe when using MCP servers?",
        "answer": "MCP servers run locally or on your infrastructure. Data only flows between your server and the target API. The skill itself does not collect, store, or transmit any user data. Authentication credentials remain in your environment."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I test if my MCP server tools work well?",
        "answer": "Create evaluation questions that require multiple tool calls. Test whether LLMs can discover and use your tools correctly. The evaluation guide provides 10 question criteria: independent, read-only, complex, realistic, verifiable, and stable answers."
      },
      {
        "question": "How does this compare to building REST APIs?",
        "answer": "MCP servers are designed specifically for LLM consumption with structured tool definitions, automatic schema generation, and annotations that help LLMs understand capabilities. REST APIs require additional wrapper logic for LLM integration. MCP provides better discoverability and type safety for AI agents."
