      {
        "question": "Is my codebase data safe during parallel agent execution?",

      },
      {
        "question": "What if agents return conflicting changes?",
        "answer": "Review each agent summary before integrating. Check which files each agent modified. If conflicts exist, resolve them manually or dispatch a coordinating agent."
      },
      {
        "question": "How is this different from running tasks sequentially?",
        "answer": "Sequential investigation waits for each task to complete before starting the next. Parallel dispatch starts all independent investigations simultaneously, reducing total debugging time significantly."
