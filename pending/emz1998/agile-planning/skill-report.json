      {
        "question": "What sprint duration should I use?",

      {
        "question": "How many tasks should be in each sprint?",
        "answer": "Plan for 3-5 tasks per sprint. This keeps work focused and manageable. Each task should be completable within the sprint by one developer. Factor in 80% capacity for realistic planning."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I handle sprint dependencies?",
        "answer": "Document dependencies explicitly in each sprint. Schedule dependent sprints sequentially. When possible, design work to run in parallel. Always include buffer time for blocked work."
      },
      {
        "question": "Should I include a buffer sprint?",
        "answer": "Yes, include a testing or polish sprint before launch. This provides space for bug fixes, performance optimization, and unexpected issues without delaying the release date."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I organize a long release (6+ sprints)?",
        "answer": "Group sprints into phases: Foundation (1-2 sprints), Features (3-4 sprints), Integration/Testing (1 sprint), Launch (1 sprint). This creates natural checkpoints and makes the plan easier to communicate."
      },
      {
        "question": "What makes a good sprint goal?",
        "answer": "A good sprint goal is one clear sentence describing what the sprint accomplishes. It should be measurable and meaningful to stakeholders. Examples: Setup payment infrastructure, Build responsive checkout flow."
