        "question": "How do I purge unused styles in production?",

      {
        "question": "What is the difference between container and mx-auto?",
        "answer": "container centers your content with max-width constraints at each breakpoint. mx-auto adds horizontal margin auto. Use container for page layout, mx-auto for centering individual elements within a larger container."

      {
        "question": "How do I create a loading spinner with Tailwind?",
        "answer": "Use border utilities with animate-spin or animate-pulse. Example: div class=\"border-4 border-gray-300 border-t-blue-500 rounded-full w-8 h-8 animate-spin\" creates a standard loading spinner."

        "question": "Can I use Tailwind for print styles?",
        "answer": "Yes, use the print: modifier. Example: class=\"print:hidden\" hides an element when printing. You can customize print behavior just like dark mode."
