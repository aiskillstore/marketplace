      },
      {
        "question": "What happens if phase validation fails?",
        "answer": "The workflow enforces iterative compliance. If validation fails, the main agent must reinvoke the responsible subagent with explicit instructions to create the missing required file, then re-run validation. This repeats until validation passes before proceeding."
      },
      {
        "question": "How are session directories organized?",
        "answer": "Session directories follow the pattern .claude/sessions/[NN]-[session-description]/ where NN is a two-digit sequential number. Each phase produces specific required files (codebase-status.md, research-report.md, implementation-plan.md, etc.) saved to this directory."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I skip phases in the EPIC workflow?",
        "answer": "No. The EPIC methodology requires completing all seven phases in sequence. Skipping exploration, research, or validation leads to incomplete context, uninformed decisions, and implementation errors that require costly rework."
      },
      {
        "question": "What tools does the main agent use during implementation?",
        "answer": "The main agent uses TodoWrite for task tracking (one task at a time, real-time status updates), Read for accessing session artifacts, Write/Edit for code implementation, and AskUserQuestion for clarification when uncertain."
      },
      {
        "question": "How does the workflow ensure quality?",
        "answer": "Quality is enforced through multiple checkpoints: consulting-expert validates the plan before implementation, test-engineer reviews test coverage during review, and iteration phase addresses all feedback until final verification passes."
