    "faq": [
      {
        "question": "Should I use TypeScript or Python for my MCP server?",
        "answer": "TypeScript is recommended for most cases due to high-quality SDK support, broad compatibility in execution environments like MCPB, and excellent AI model generation quality. Python with FastMCP is a good alternative for Python-heavy ecosystems or when you prefer Python's syntax."
      },
      {
        "question": "Should I build comprehensive API coverage or specialized workflow tools?",
        "answer": "Prioritize comprehensive API coverage. This gives agents flexibility to compose operations. While workflow tools can be convenient, some clients support code execution that can combine basic tools effectively. When uncertain, comprehensive coverage is the safer choice."
      },
      {
        "question": "What transport should I use for my MCP server?",
        "answer": "Use streamable HTTP with stateless JSON for remote servers (easier to scale and maintain). Use stdio for local integrations and command-line tools. Avoid SSE as it's deprecated in favor of streamable HTTP."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I test my MCP server effectively?",
        "answer": "Use the MCP Inspector for manual testing during development. Create comprehensive evaluations with 10+ realistic questions that require multiple tool calls and test real-world workflows. Run evaluations using the provided scripts with Claude to measure effectiveness."
      },
      {
        "question": "What makes a good evaluation question?",
        "answer": "Good questions are: independent (not dependent on other questions), read-only (non-destructive), complex (requiring multiple tool calls), realistic (based on real use cases), verifiable (single clear answer), and stable (answer won't change over time). They should test deep exploration, not simple keyword searches."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I handle pagination in my tools?",
        "answer": "Always respect the limit parameter, implement offset or cursor-based pagination, return metadata (has_more, next_offset, total_count), and never load all results into memory. Default to 20-50 items per page."
