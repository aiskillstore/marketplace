    "faq": [
      {
        "question": "Should I use Python (FastMCP) or TypeScript for my MCP server?",
        "answer": "TypeScript is recommended for most cases due to high-quality SDK support, broad compatibility, and excellent static typing. Use Python if you're integrating with Python-specific libraries or have existing Python infrastructure. Both have full-featured SDKs and comprehensive guides."
      },
      {
        "question": "What's the difference between tools, resources, and prompts in MCP?",
        "answer": "Tools are functions that perform operations (API calls, computations). Resources expose data via URI templates for efficient access. Prompts are reusable templates for common tasks. Most MCP servers primarily implement tools for maximum flexibility."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I choose between streamable HTTP and stdio transport?",
        "answer": "Use streamable HTTP for remote servers, web services, and multi-client scenarios. Use stdio for local integrations, command-line tools, and single-user workflows. Streamable HTTP with stateless JSON is recommended for scalability."
      },
      {
        "question": "What makes a good evaluation question?",
        "answer": "Good questions are: (1) complex, requiring multiple tool calls, (2) realistic use cases, (3) read-only and non-destructive, (4) independent of other questions, (5) have stable answers that won't change, and (6) answers are verifiable with direct string comparison."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I run the evaluation scripts?",
        "answer": "Install dependencies: `pip install -r scripts/requirements.txt`. Set API key: `export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=key`. Run: `python scripts/evaluation.py -t stdio -c python -a your_server.py evaluation.xml`. For streamable HTTP servers, start the server first, then use `-t http -u http://localhost:3000/mcp`."
      },
      {
        "question": "Should I implement comprehensive API coverage or specialized workflow tools?",
        "answer": "Prioritize comprehensive API coverage for flexibility. Agents can compose basic tools into workflows. Some clients support code execution which helps combine operations. Add specialized workflow tools for very common patterns, but comprehensive coverage gives agents more power."
