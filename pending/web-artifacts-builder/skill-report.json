      {
        "question": "Why does the bundle file size seem large?",
        "answer": "The bundle includes React, all dependencies, CSS, and JavaScript inlined into a single HTML file. This is expected for self-contained artifacts."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I use this with Node.js 16?",
        "answer": "No, Node.js 18+ is required. The script auto-detects your version and configures compatible Vite versions for Node 18 vs 20+."

      {
        "question": "What shadcn/ui components are included?",
        "answer": "40+ components including accordion, alert, avatar, badge, button, calendar, card, carousel, checkbox, dialog, dropdown, form, input, label, select, sheet, table, tabs, toast, tooltip, and many more."
      },
      {
        "question": "Do I need to install shadcn/ui components manually?",
        "answer": "No, the init script pre-installs all 40+ shadcn/ui components and their Radix UI dependencies automatically."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can bundled artifacts run offline?",
        "answer": "Yes, bundle.html is completely self-contained with no external dependencies, so it works offline and as a claude.ai artifact."

      {
        "question": "Should I test artifacts before sharing them?",
