      },
      {
        "question": "Do I need to install shadcn/ui components manually?",

      {
        "question": "What's the difference between init-artifact.sh and bundle-artifact.sh?",
        "answer": "init-artifact.sh creates the initial React project with all dependencies. bundle-artifact.sh is run after development to combine everything into a single HTML file for sharing."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I use this with Node 16 or lower?",
        "answer": "No, Node 18+ is required. The script auto-detects your Node version and configures Vite compatibility accordingly."

      {
        "question": "How large are the bundled artifacts?",
        "answer": "Bundle sizes vary based on components used, but expect several hundred KB to 1-2MB for full-featured apps due to React, Radix UI, and component libraries being inlined."
