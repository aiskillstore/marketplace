      {

      },
      {
        "question": "What components are included in the shadcn/ui library?",
        "answer": "40+ components including: accordion, alert, avatar, badge, button, calendar, card, carousel, checkbox, command, dialog, drawer, dropdown-menu, form, input, label, popover, progress, scroll-area, select, separator, sheet, slider, switch, table, tabs, textarea, toast, tooltip, and many more."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I use external libraries or APIs in my artifact?",
        "answer": "You can include additional npm packages during development, but the bundled artifact is self-contained. External APIs can be called client-side, but the artifact cannot include server-side functionality."
      },
      {
        "question": "How large are the bundled HTML files?",
        "answer": "Bundle sizes vary but typically range from 500KB to 2MB depending on components used. React and the component library add baseline size, so this approach is best for complex artifacts where the functionality justifies the size."
      },
      {
        "question": "What Node.js version do I need?",
        "answer": "Node.js 18 or higher is required. The skill auto-detects your Node version and pins compatible Vite versions (5.4.11 for Node 18, latest for Node 20+)."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I customize the theming and styling?",
        "answer": "Yes, the setup includes a full Tailwind CSS configuration with shadcn/ui's CSS variable-based theming system. You can customize colors, radius, and other design tokens in tailwind.config.js and src/index.css."
