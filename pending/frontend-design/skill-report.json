      {
        "question": "What frameworks and technologies does this skill support?",

      },
      {
        "question": "Will the generated designs be accessible?",
        "answer": "While the skill focuses on aesthetic quality, it generates production-grade code. For critical accessibility requirements, explicitly mention them in your request to ensure proper ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, and contrast ratios."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I avoid getting generic-looking designs?",
        "answer": "Provide context about your project's purpose and audience. The skill is specifically designed to avoid generic aesthetics, but richer context enables more distinctive, contextually-appropriate creative choices."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I specify exact colors and fonts, or should I let it choose?",
        "answer": "Both approaches work. You can specify exact design tokens if you have a design system, or provide aesthetic direction and let the skill make bold creative choices. Avoid generic choices like 'use Inter font' unless required by existing brand guidelines."
      },
      {
        "question": "What's the difference between maximalist and minimalist approaches?",
        "answer": "Both can be distinctive. Maximalist designs use elaborate code with extensive animations, overlapping elements, and rich visual details. Minimalist designs require precise spacing, refined typography, and subtle micro-interactions. The key is intentionality and execution quality, not complexity level."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is this suitable for enterprise/corporate projects?",
        "answer": "Yes, but frame your request appropriately. Enterprise projects can still have distinctive, refined aesthetics within professional constraints. Mention any brand guidelines, accessibility requirements, or technical limitations upfront."
