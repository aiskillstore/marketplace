      "Create atmospheric backgrounds with gradients, textures, or patterns instead of solid colors",

      {
        "question": "What frameworks does this skill support?",

      },
      {
        "question": "How do I get the best results from this skill?",
        "answer": "Provide context about your project's purpose, target audience, and aesthetic preferences. The more specific you are about the tone and direction you want (e.g., 'brutally minimal,' 'retro-futuristic,' 'organic'), the better the output will match your vision."
      },
      {
        "question": "Will the generated code be production-ready?",
        "answer": "Yes, the skill generates functional, production-grade code. However, you may need to integrate it with your existing codebase, add backend connections, or adjust for specific technical requirements."
      },
      {
        "question": "How does this avoid generic AI aesthetics?",
        "answer": "The skill explicitly avoids common AI design patterns (like overused fonts and purple gradients) by committing to bold, context-specific aesthetic directions. It varies typography, color schemes, and layouts across generations to create truly distinctive interfaces."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I request specific design styles or themes?",
        "answer": "Absolutely! You can request specific aesthetics like minimalist, maximalist, brutalist, art deco, industrial, editorial, retro-futuristic, or describe your own unique direction. The more specific your vision, the better."
