It emphasizes bold creative choices, sophisticated typography, intentional color theory, and cohesive aesthetic execution rather than defaulting to safe, common patterns."

      {
        "question": "Can I use this for production applications?",

      {
        "question": "What if I don't like the aesthetic direction chosen?",

        "question": "Does this work with specific frameworks like Next.js or Vue?",

      {
        "question": "Will every design be maximalist or over-the-top?",
        "answer": "No. The skill matches implementation complexity to the aesthetic vision. Refined minimalism and bold maximalism are both valid directions - the key is intentional execution rather than defaulting to safe middle-ground designs."

      {
        "question": "Can I get just the HTML/CSS without JavaScript?",
