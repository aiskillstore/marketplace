      {
        "question": "How does this avoid 'generic AI aesthetics'?",
        "answer": "The skill explicitly avoids overused patterns like Inter font, purple gradients, and predictable layouts. It commits to bold, context-specific aesthetic directions with distinctive typography, unexpected layouts, and creative visual details that vary between projects."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is the generated code production-ready?",
        "answer": "Yes, the skill generates functional, production-grade code with accessibility considerations, responsive design, and performance optimizations. However, you may need to integrate it with your specific backend or business logic."
      },
      {
        "question": "How specific should I be with my design requirements?",
        "answer": "Provide context about purpose, target audience, and technical constraints. You can specify an aesthetic direction (brutalist, maximalist, etc.) or let the skill propose one. The more context you provide, the more tailored the output."

      {
        "question": "Can it create both minimalist and maximalist designs?",
        "answer": "Yes, the skill excels at both extremes when executed with intentionality. Minimalist designs focus on precision, spacing, and subtle details, while maximalist designs include elaborate animations, rich visual effects, and complex compositions."
