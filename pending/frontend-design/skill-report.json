    "faq": [
      {
        "question": "What frameworks does this skill support?",
        "answer": "The skill supports vanilla HTML/CSS/JS, React, Vue, and other modern frontend frameworks. Specify your technical constraints in the prompt for framework-specific implementations."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I ensure the design matches my brand?",
        "answer": "Provide context about your brand's purpose, audience, and desired tone. Specify an aesthetic direction (e.g., 'luxury refined' or 'playful toy-like') that aligns with your brand identity. The more context you provide, the better the design will match your needs."
      },
      {
        "question": "Will the generated code be accessible and performant?",
        "answer": "Yes, the skill emphasizes production-grade code that considers accessibility and performance, even with bold aesthetics. However, always test with your specific requirements and users."
      },
      {
        "question": "What if I want a minimalist design instead of maximalist?",
        "answer": "Both minimalist and maximalist approaches work - the key is intentionality. For minimalist designs, the skill will focus on precision, refined typography, careful spacing, and subtle details rather than elaborate effects."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I specify exact colors or fonts to use?",
        "answer": "Yes! Include specific design requirements in your prompt (e.g., 'use our brand colors: #FF6B6B and #4ECDC4' or 'must use our brand font Montserrat'). The skill will incorporate your constraints while maintaining design quality."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I avoid getting similar designs each time?",
        "answer": "The skill is designed to vary aesthetics between projects. To ensure diversity, specify different aesthetic directions, tones, or unique elements you want emphasized. Each project should feel contextually appropriate rather than templated."
