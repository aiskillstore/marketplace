    "faq": [
      {
        "question": "What frameworks does this skill support?",
        "answer": "The skill can generate code for HTML/CSS/JavaScript, React, Vue, and other modern frontend frameworks. Specify your preference in the prompt for best results."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I ensure the design matches my brand?",
        "answer": "Provide context about your product, audience, and desired tone/aesthetic direction. The more specific you are about the feeling or style you want, the better the output will match your vision."
      },
      {
        "question": "Will the code be production-ready?",

      },
      {
        "question": "Can I request specific design elements or constraints?",
        "answer": "Absolutely. Specify technical constraints (framework, performance needs), required features, accessibility requirements, or specific visual elements you want included."
      },
      {
        "question": "What if I want a minimal design instead of bold/maximal?",
        "answer": "The skill supports both extremes. Minimalism requires precision and restraint in code - careful spacing, typography, and subtle details. Specify your preference for refined minimalism in your prompt."
      },
      {
        "question": "How does this avoid generic AI aesthetics?",
        "answer": "The skill actively avoids common AI design patterns by choosing distinctive fonts, creating context-specific designs, using varied aesthetics across generations, and making intentional creative choices rather than defaulting to safe options."
