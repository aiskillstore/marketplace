## Critical Perspective

**Important:** SMC/ICT is a framework, not a guaranteed system. Consider:

1. **Survivorship bias** - You see successful traders, not failures
2. **Self-fulfilling prophecy** - Patterns work partly because many watch them
3. **Cherry-picked examples** - Education often shows perfect setups
4. **Risk management** - No analysis replaces proper risk control

The detection algorithms in this skill identify patterns. Whether those patterns have predictive value in your specific market/timeframe requires your own validation and backtesting.
