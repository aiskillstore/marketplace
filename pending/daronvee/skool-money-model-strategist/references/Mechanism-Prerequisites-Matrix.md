# Hormozi Mechanism Prerequisites Matrix

**Purpose**: Strict validation checklist to prevent misapplication of Hormozi's 15 money model mechanisms.

**Usage**: Before recommending any mechanism, verify ALL prerequisites are met. If ANY prerequisite is missing, the mechanism doesn't apply.

---

## Mechanism #1: Win Your Money Back

**Definition**: Customers get their initial purchase refunded if they complete specific requirements (actions or outcomes)

**Source**: [Hormozi-Skool-Money-Models-Reference.md:lines 44-89](Hormozi-Skool-Money-Models-Reference.md)

### MUST HAVE (Prerequisites)
- [ ] One-time purchase amount that can be "won back"
- [ ] Defined winning requirements (action-based OR outcome-based)
- [ ] Two-tier structure (winner price vs non-winner price)
- [ ] Credit calculation method (how money is returned/credited)
- [ ] Winners get price reduction or credit applied to future purchases

### CANNOT BE
- ❌ Simple refund policy (no requirements = not this mechanism)
- ❌ Discount for engagement (that's just pricing variation)
- ❌ Money-back guarantee with no winning conditions
- ❌ Free trial (no initial purchase to win back)

### Validation Questions
1. Is there a specific amount being "won back"?
2. Are there clear, measurable winning requirements?
3. Does winning result in CREDIT or PRICE REDUCTION?
4. Are there TWO tiers (winner pricing vs non-winner pricing)?

### Common Misidentification
**Wrong**: "Offer a discount if they engage" → That's not Win Money Back
**Right**: "Charge $1000 upfront, credit back $100/month if they maintain 30-day streak" → This IS Win Money Back

---

## Mechanism #2: Giveaways

**Definition**: Run contest with grand prize, then offer losers discounted purchase

**Source**: [Hormozi-Skool-Money-Models-Reference.md:lines 91-136](Hormozi-Skool-Money-Models-Reference.md)

### MUST HAVE (Prerequisites)
- [ ] Contest/drawing with clear entry mechanism
- [ ] Grand prize (product/service given free)
- [ ] Non-winners identified (everyone who didn't win)
- [ ] Discounted offer presented to non-winners after drawing
- [ ] Time-limited offer window for non-winners

### CANNOT BE
- ❌ Lead magnet (no contest element)
- ❌ Free trial (no winner selection)
- ❌ Standard promotion (no grand prize drawing)

### Validation Questions
1. Is there an actual contest with a winner selection?
2. Do non-winners get offered something at a discount?
3. Is the discount time-limited to create urgency?

---

## Mechanism #3: Decoy Offer

**Definition**: Offer two options where the expensive one makes the cheaper one look like a steal (but cheaper one is what you want most to buy)

**Source**: [Hormozi-Skool-Money-Models-Reference.md:lines 138-179](Hormozi-Skool-Money-Models-Reference.md)

### MUST HAVE (Prerequisites)
- [ ] TWO options presented simultaneously
- [ ] Higher-priced option (the "decoy")
- [ ] Lower-priced option (the actual target)
- [ ] Decoy includes extras that justify higher price BUT most people don't need
- [ ] Price relationship makes lower option feel like smart value choice

### CANNOT BE
- ❌ Standard tiered pricing (that's just options)
- ❌ Upsell sequence (presented sequentially, not simultaneously)
- ❌ Volume discount (Buy X Get Y)

### Validation Questions
1. Are BOTH options visible at the same time?
2. Does the expensive option make the cheaper one feel like a better deal?
3. Is the cheaper option what you ACTUALLY want most people to buy?
4. Does the decoy have extras most people don't need?

### Strategic Note
**Key Distinction**: Decoy pricing is about ANCHORING. The expensive option exists primarily to make the target option feel more valuable, not to be purchased frequently.

---

## Mechanism #6: Classic Upsell

**Definition**: Move customers to higher-value offers after initial purchase

**Source**: [Hormozi-Skool-Money-Models-Reference.md:lines 310-340](Hormozi-Skool-Money-Models-Reference.md)

### MUST HAVE (Prerequisites)
- [ ] Customer already made initial purchase
- [ ] Higher-value offer exists (can be more of same, upgrade, or complementary)
- [ ] Clear value proposition for upgrade
- [ ] Presented AFTER initial commitment

### THREE VALID UPSELL PATHS
1. **Next Problem**: Solving A creates need for B (e.g., website built → now need SEO)
2. **Solution Upgrade**: DIY → DWY → DFY progression (e.g., course → coaching → done-for-you)
3. **Awareness Creation**: Solving A makes customer aware of B (e.g., fix nutrition → now aware of sleep issues)

### CANNOT BE
- ❌ Initial offer (must be AFTER first purchase)
- ❌ Cross-sell to unrelated product (must have logical connection)
- ❌ Rollover (see Mechanism #9 for differences)

### Validation Questions
1. Has the customer already committed to something?
2. Is the upsell a logical next step or upgrade?
3. Which upsell path does this follow? (Next Problem / Solution Upgrade / Awareness Creation)

### Common Misidentification
**Wrong**: "Offer annual plan at signup" → That's initial offer choice, not upsell
**Right**: "After 7 days on monthly, offer annual upgrade" → This IS Classic Upsell

---

## Mechanism #9: Rollover Upsell

**Definition**: Existing payment/credit rolls forward into new offer

**Source**: [Hormozi-Skool-Money-Models-Reference.md:lines 450-475](Hormozi-Skool-Money-Models-Reference.md)

### MUST HAVE (Prerequisites)
- [ ] Customer has EXISTING payment, credit, or prepaid balance
- [ ] That existing payment/credit CAN TRANSFER to new offer
- [ ] New offer is presented as "use what you already paid"
- [ ] Financial barrier reduced because they've already paid

### CANNOT BE
- ❌ Regular upsell (no existing credit rolling forward)
- ❌ Annual upgrade (unless monthly payments roll into annual price)
- ❌ Subscription upgrade (unless credit transfers)

### Validation Questions
1. Does the customer have existing payment or credit?
2. Can that payment/credit roll into the new offer?
3. Are you explicitly saying "your $X already paid can go toward Y"?

### Critical Distinction from Classic Upsell
**Classic Upsell**: "Upgrade to annual for $997" (new payment)
**Rollover Upsell**: "Your 3 months of monthly payments ($297) can roll into annual membership - just pay the difference of $700"

---

## Mechanism #11: Trial with Penalty

**Definition**: Trial period where something is at risk if they don't convert

**Source**: [Hormozi-Skool-Money-Models-Reference.md:lines 250-275](Hormozi-Skool-Money-Models-Reference.md)

### MUST HAVE (Prerequisites)
- [ ] Trial period defined
- [ ] Something AT RISK (deposit, data, achievement progress, access)
- [ ] Penalty activates if they DON'T convert
- [ ] Penalty is MEANINGFUL enough to influence behavior

### WHAT COUNTS AS "AT RISK"
- Deposit that is forfeited if no purchase
- Data/progress that is deleted if no conversion
- Achievement badges/levels that are reset
- Access to completed work that is removed

### CANNOT BE
- ❌ Standard free trial (no penalty = not this mechanism)
- ❌ Money-back guarantee (no penalty for not continuing)
- ❌ Demo period with no risk
- ❌ "Lose access" (that's just trial ending, not a penalty)

### Validation Questions
1. What SPECIFICALLY is at risk?
2. What happens if they don't convert? (If "nothing", it's NOT this mechanism)
3. Is the penalty meaningful enough to influence behavior?
4. Would you lose something you value if you don't buy?

### Common Misidentification (FROM POST-MORTEM SESSION 1)
**WRONG**: "7-day free trial, then $97/month" → NO PENALTY = NOT "Trial with Penalty"
**RIGHT**: "$10 deposit for 7-day trial, deposit refunded on purchase OR forfeited if no purchase" → THIS is Trial with Penalty

**Critical**: If there's no actual penalty (loss of deposit, loss of data, loss of progress), it's just a standard free trial, NOT Mechanism #11.

---

## Mechanism #14: Continuity Discount Offers

**Definition**: Front-load value to encourage long-term commitment

**Source**: [Hormozi-Skool-Money-Models-Reference.md:lines 700-740](Hormozi-Skool-Money-Models-Reference.md)

### MUST HAVE (Prerequisites)
- [ ] Subscription/continuity offer exists
- [ ] Discount is time-limited or conditional
- [ ] Discount incentivizes LONGER commitment (annual vs monthly)
- [ ] Clear savings calculation shown

### VALID STRUCTURES
- "Buy X Get Y Free" (Buy 6 months, get 6 free)
- "Early bird pricing" (First 100 members get lower rate forever)
- "Annual discount" (12 months for price of 10)

### CANNOT BE
- ❌ Standard pricing (not a discount)
- ❌ Decoy pricing (see Mechanism #3)
- ❌ One-time purchase (must be continuity/recurring)

### Validation Questions
1. Is this a recurring/continuity offer?
2. Does the discount encourage longer commitment?
3. Is there urgency or limitation on the discount?

---

## Tier-Based Mechanisms (Special Category)

Some mechanisms specifically use tier relationships to influence buying decisions:

### Mechanism #3: Decoy Offer
**Applied to Tiers**: Premium tier priced close to middle tier (1.1-1.3x) makes premium obvious choice

**Example**:
- Middle tier: $897/year
- Premium tier: $997/year (only 11% more)
- Psychology: "For just $100 more, I get everything + direct access!"

### Mechanism #8: Anchor Upsell
**Applied to Tiers**: Premium tier priced 3-5x higher makes base tier feel affordable

**Example**:
- Base tier: $97/month
- Premium tier: $497/month (5x higher)
- Psychology: "I don't need premium, I'll save money with base"

**See**: [Tier-Design-Strategies.md](Tier-Design-Strategies.md) for complete tier relationship frameworks.

## How to Use This Matrix

**Before recommending any mechanism**:

1. **Look up the mechanism** in this matrix
2. **Read the MUST HAVE section** - verify ALL checkboxes
3. **Read the CANNOT BE section** - ensure you're not confusing mechanisms
4. **Answer validation questions** - if you can't answer clearly, mechanism doesn't apply
5. **Check source reference** - read actual definition from main reference doc
6. **If prerequisites met** → Proceed with recommendation (with source citation)
7. **If prerequisites NOT met** → Find different mechanism OR explain no mechanism matches

**Remember**: It's better to say "This doesn't match any of Hormozi's 15 mechanisms exactly" than to force-fit a mechanism incorrectly.
