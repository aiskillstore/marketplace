    "description": "Applies Alex Hormozi's $100M Money Models frameworks to design, evaluate, and improve Skool community monetization strategies. Uses CAC-based stage diagnosis (5 stages), 30-day cash maximization formulas, and sequential implementation to create actionable roadmaps grounded in Hormozi's 15 money model mechanisms and Skool's 5 business models (Free, Subscription, Freemium, Tiers, One-Time). Helps Skool community owners identify which mechanisms to implement, validate money models against Hormozi principles, and create step-by-step Skool setup instructions for maximum revenue per customer in 30 days.\n",
