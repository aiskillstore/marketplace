  "description": "Design production-grade Helm charts through architectural reasoning rather than pattern\nretrieval. Activate when designing new Helm charts for Kubernetes deployments, evaluating\nchart architecture, making decisions about component packaging, or reviewing charts for\nextensibility and maintainability. Guides decision-making about dependencies, lifecycle\nhooks, configuration surface, and multi-environment deployment through context-specific\nreasoning rather than generic best practices.\n",
