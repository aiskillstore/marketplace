  "description": "Autonomous multi-agent workflow system for complex coding tasks. Use when the user requests non-trivial changes that would benefit from autonomous execution with built-in review gates. Ideal for refactoring modules, adding major features, migrating codebases, adding comprehensive test coverage, or any multi-step development task that can run autonomously. NOT for simple fixes, typos, or single-file changes.",
