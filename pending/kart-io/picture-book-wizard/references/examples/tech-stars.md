## Notes on This Example

**Why This Combination Works**:
- Tech style transforms traditional stargazing into futuristic wonder
- Stars scene naturally supports glowing, holographic elements
- Looking up pose creates sense of awe and discovery
- Cool color palette contrasts with Yueyue's warm outfit

**Character Learning**:
- 星 is fundamental for astronomy and night concepts
- The character appears twice in 星星 (xīngxing - star)
- Visual reinforcement strong: glowing stars in image match character
- Pronunciation practice with repeated syllable

**Technical Highlights**:
- "Holographic stars" creates dimension and depth
- "Circuit patterns connecting stars" adds tech storytelling
- Blue/purple palette distinctive from other styles
- "Light bloom effects" creates ethereal glow
- "Various depths" suggests 3D space

**Style-Specific Notes**:
- Tech style uses "glossy reflective surfaces" vs clay's "matte"
- "Digital glow effect" replaces natural lighting
- "Holographic" is key tech style identifier
- Cool colors (blue/purple) vs warm (clay's earth tones)

**Variations You Could Make**:
- Add interaction: "reaching hand toward holographic star"
- Change tech elements: "data streams" or "pixel particles"
- Adjust intensity: "subtle glow" vs "intense neon"
- Include devices: "holographic star map interface" nearby
