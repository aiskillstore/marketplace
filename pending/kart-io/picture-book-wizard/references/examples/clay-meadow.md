## Notes on This Example

**Why This Combination Works**:
- Clay style provides warm, tactile quality perfect for nature scenes
- Meadow setting is grounded and relatable for young children
- Discovery action encourages curiosity and exploration
- Grass character (草) is fundamental and visually present in scene

**Character Learning**:
- 草 is a basic HSK 1 level character
- The radical 艹 (grass radical) is visible and learnable
- Pronunciation is simple (cǎo - third tone)
- Concept directly matches visual scene

**Technical Highlights**:
- "Kneeling" pose makes Yueyue interactive with environment
- "In her palm" creates intimate discovery moment
- Specific flower colors add visual interest
- Ground-level perspective enhances immersion

**Variations You Could Make**:
- Change time of day: "morning dew on grass" or "golden afternoon light"
- Change action: "running through" instead of "kneeling on"
- Add elements: "butterfly landing nearby" or "ladybug on leaf"
- Adjust mood: "excited expression" vs "gentle smile"
