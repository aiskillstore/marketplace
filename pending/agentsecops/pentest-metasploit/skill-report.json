      },
      {
        "question": "Does this skill execute exploits automatically?",
        "answer": "No, this skill provides documentation and guidance only. Actual exploit execution requires separate installation of Metasploit Framework and is performed by the user in their own environment with proper authorization."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I map Metasploit activities to MITRE ATT&CK?",
        "answer": "Use the MITRE ATT&CK mapping section which documents common TTPs: Initial Access (T1190), Execution (T1059), Persistence (T1547), Privilege Escalation (T1068), Credential Access (T1003), and Lateral Movement (T1021)."
      },
      {
        "question": "What authorization is required for penetration testing?",
        "answer": "Written authorization from the asset owner is mandatory. Document scope, testing windows, target systems, and emergency contacts before starting. Maintain the penetration testing agreement throughout the engagement."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I handle discovered credentials during testing?",
        "answer": "Document credentials found but do not access systems beyond scope. Follow engagement rules for data handling. Report findings immediately per escalation procedures. Maintain chain of custody for forensic evidence."
      },
      {
        "question": "How is this different from automated vulnerability scanners?",
        "answer": "Metasploit provides exploitation capabilities rather than just detection. This enables validation of vulnerability impact, testing of defensive controls, and realistic attack simulation. Use with appropriate authorization and controls."
