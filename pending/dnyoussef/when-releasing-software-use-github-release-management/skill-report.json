Coordinates release-manager, cicd-engineer, tester, and docs-writer agents through hierarchical topology to handle semantic versioning, changelog generation, release notes, deployment validation, and post-release monitoring. Supports multiple release strategies (rolling, blue-green, canary) and automated rollback. Use when creating releases, managing deployments, or coordinating version updates.",

        "question": "Does this skill deploy to any hosting platform?",
        "answer": "No. The skill orchestrates agents but requires your own deployment scripts. The deploy.sh script handles platform-specific deployment."

      {
        "question": "How does rollback work?",
        "answer": "The skill monitors health metrics during deployment. If error rate exceeds thresholds, it triggers rollback to the previous version using rollback.sh."

      {
        "question": "Is my repository data safe?",
