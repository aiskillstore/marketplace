      {
        "question": "Can I customize the scoring weights?",
        "answer": "Yes. You can set custom weights for each criterion in user-profile.yaml. The default weights are trending=4, controversy=2, value=3, relevance=1. You can also adjust the 7-point threshold."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is the user profile file for?",
        "answer": "The user profile at ~/.claude/skills/x-create/references/user-profile.md defines your account domains and persona style. This enables personalized relevance scoring based on how well each topic aligns with your content focus."

      {
        "question": "Does x-filter create content?",
        "answer": "No. x-filter only scores and filters topics. After filtering, you can use x-create to generate actual X content from the recommended topics. These skills work together in a complete workflow."
      },
      {
        "question": "What happens if I do not have a user profile?",
        "answer": "Without a user profile, the skill assumes default domains of AI/科技, 创业, and 个人成长 for relevance scoring. Setting up a user profile improves scoring accuracy for your specific content focus."
