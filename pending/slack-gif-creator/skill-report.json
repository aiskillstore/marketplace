      {
        "question": "How do I reduce the file size of my GIF?",
        "answer": "Use fewer frames (lower FPS like 10), reduce num_colors (48 instead of 128), enable optimize_for_emoji=True, and set remove_duplicates=True in the save() method."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I use uploaded images in my animations?",
