      "Don't skip validation - always check that GIFs meet Slack requirements before delivery",
      "Avoid plain geometric shapes without depth - add gradients, highlights, or layered elements",
      "Don't assume pre-packaged graphics exist in the skill - generate everything from PIL primitives",
      "Don't optimize prematurely - create the animation first, then optimize if file size is too large",
      "Avoid linear interpolation for all motion - use easing functions for more natural movement"

      {
        "question": "What size should my Slack GIF be?",

      },
      {
        "question": "Why is my GIF file size too large?",
        "answer": "Reduce frames (use 10fps instead of 20), decrease colors (num_colors=48), enable remove_duplicates=True, or use optimize_for_emoji=True for automatic optimization. Target under 100KB for emoji."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I use uploaded images in my animations?",

        "question": "What animation effects are supported?",

      {
        "question": "How do I make animations look more professional?",
        "answer": "Use thicker lines (width=2+), add gradients, layer multiple shapes, apply easing functions (not linear), use contrasting colors, and add visual depth with highlights or shadows."
