# Research Index

Research files that inform implementation decisions.

## Active Research

[Add research links as they are created]

## Archive Policy

Research files are kept in this directory for reference. When a research file is fully integrated into task documentation:
1. The task file should have `%% [x] %%` marking the research as applied
2. A `> **Research:** See [[../research/file]]` link should exist
3. The research file remains here for future reference
