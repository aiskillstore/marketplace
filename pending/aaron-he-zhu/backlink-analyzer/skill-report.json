      {

      {
        "question": "How often should I analyze my backlink profile?",

      },
      {
        "question": "What is a toxic link and when should I disavow it?",
        "answer": "Toxic links are from spammy domains, private blog networks (PBNs), or link farms that can trigger Google penalties. Disavow only when you have clear evidence of manipulation risk. Low-quality links are not necessarily toxic."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can this skill automatically submit disavow files to Google?",
        "answer": "No. This skill generates disavow file recommendations in the correct text format, but you must manually upload the file to Google Search Console. This ensures you review all disavow decisions."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is link intersection analysis?",
        "answer": "Link intersection identifies domains that link to multiple competitors but not to your site. These represent high-value opportunities because the domains have demonstrated willingness to link to content in your niche."
      },
      {
        "question": "What are healthy benchmarks for a backlink profile?",
        "answer": "Healthy profiles typically have 60-80% dofollow links, less than 15% exact match anchor text, 25-45% brand anchors, under 5% toxic links, and positive steady growth in referring domains."
