      {
        "question": "Can I use this with microservices?",

        "question": "Why is my token validation failing?",
        "answer": "Check that clock time is synchronized on your server, verify the secret key matches exactly, and ensure tokens include required claims."

      {
        "question": "How does this compare to session-based auth?",
        "answer": "JWT is stateless and scales horizontally across services. Sessions require server storage but offer immediate revocation. Choose based on your architecture needs."
