## Texture Types

### Surface Textures

| Category | Examples | Rendering Approach |
|----------|----------|-------------------|
| **Smooth** | Glass, plastic, liquid | Reflections, clean gradients |
| **Rough** | Stone, concrete, bark | Noise, irregular patterns |
| **Soft** | Fabric, fur, clouds | Fuzzy edges, subtle gradients |
| **Metallic** | Steel, gold, chrome | High contrast reflections |
| **Organic** | Skin, leaves, wood | Subtle variation, imperfection |
| **Patterned** | Brick, tile, fabric | Repeating elements |

### Texture Rendering Methods

| Method | Description | Use Case |
|--------|-------------|----------|
| **Painted** | Hand-rendered strokes | Illustration, concept |
| **Photo-based** | Real texture overlays | Realistic, game art |
| **Procedural** | Algorithm-generated | 3D, scalable |
| **Flat** | No texture, solid color | Minimal, flat design |
| **Stylized** | Simplified texture hints | Stylized games, animation |
| **Pattern-based** | Repeating motifs | Decorative, fabric |

## Detail Distribution

### Focal Point Principle
- **Primary focus**: Maximum detail
- **Secondary elements**: Medium detail
- **Background/Context**: Minimal detail
- **Rule**: Detail draws attention; use strategically

### Distance-Based Detail

| Zone | Detail Level | Purpose |
|------|--------------|---------|
| **Close-up/Foreground** | High | Immersion, examination |
| **Mid-range** | Medium | Context, navigation |
| **Background/Far** | Low | Atmosphere, scale |
