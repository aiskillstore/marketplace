    "faq": [
      {
        "question": "What is an algorithmic philosophy?",
        "answer": "An algorithmic philosophy is a computational aesthetic movement expressed through code - a manifesto describing how mathematical processes, emergent behavior, and parametric systems create beauty. It guides the implementation by defining the algorithmic approach (flow fields, particle systems, recursion, etc.) rather than prescribing specific visual outcomes."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why use seeded randomness?",
        "answer": "Seeded randomness ensures reproducibility - the same seed always produces identical artwork. This is critical for Art Blocks-style generative art where collectors want to preserve specific variations. It also enables seed navigation (prev/next) to explore the parameter space systematically."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I create 3D generative art?",
        "answer": "The skill documentation focuses on 2D p5.js canvas work. While p5.js supports WebGL and 3D rendering, the templates and examples provided are optimized for 2D generative techniques like flow fields, particle systems, and canvas-based rendering."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I share the generated art?",
        "answer": "The output is a self-contained HTML file that works immediately in any browser. You can save it and share the file directly, or it displays as an interactive artifact in Claude.ai. Users can download PNG snapshots using the built-in download functionality."
      },
      {
        "question": "What should parameters control?",
        "answer": "Parameters should control fundamental properties of your algorithmic system: quantities (how many elements), scales (size, speed), probabilities, ratios, angles, and thresholds where behavior changes. They should emerge naturally from what the algorithm needs, not be arbitrary pattern selectors."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is the 'subtle conceptual reference'?",
        "answer": "The skill emphasizes embedding sophisticated, niche conceptual threads into the algorithm itself - not literal representations. Like a jazz musician quoting another song through harmony, the reference should enhance depth for those who recognize it while everyone else simply experiences masterful generative art. It's the soul woven invisibly into parameters and emergence patterns."
