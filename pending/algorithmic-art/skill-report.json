      {
        "question": "Do I need to write the p5.js algorithm myself?",
        "answer": "Yes, the skill helps you create original algorithmic art. You design the algorithmic philosophy, and Claude implements it in p5.js code. The template and best practices guide implementation, but the algorithm should be unique to your artistic vision."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I use this without knowing p5.js?",
        "answer": "You don't need to write p5.js yourself, but understanding basic concepts (particles, vectors, noise, randomness) helps you communicate your artistic vision to Claude. The skill handles the implementation."
      },
      {
        "question": "What makes the art 'algorithmic' versus just random?",
        "answer": "Algorithmic art uses computational rules and processes to generate beauty. It's not random noise—it's controlled chaos. Parameters like seed values, noise scales, and particle behaviors create intentional patterns that feel meticulously crafted."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I share the generated art?",
        "answer": "The output is a self-contained HTML file. Save it, send it via email, host it on a website, or open it in any browser. No server or dependencies needed—everything is embedded in the file."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I modify the generated HTML after creation?",
        "answer": "Yes. The HTML is fully editable. You can adjust parameters, colors, algorithm logic, or UI controls. Code comments mark what's fixed (template) versus variable (your algorithm)."
      },
      {
        "question": "What's the difference between seed navigation buttons?",
        "answer": "Previous/Next step through seeds sequentially (e.g., 123 → 122 or 124). Random generates a new random seed. Jump-to-seed goes directly to a specific seed number. All produce deterministic outputs for that seed."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why is seeded randomness important?",
        "answer": "Seeded randomness ensures that the same seed always produces identical output, enabling reproducibility and variation exploration. Users can save and revisit favorite variations by noting the seed number."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I export high-resolution images?",
        "answer": "The template includes a download button for PNG export. Resolution depends on the canvas size in your algorithm. You can modify the canvas dimensions in the setup() function for higher resolutions."
      },
      {
        "question": "How many parameters should my art have?",
        "answer": "3-5 meaningful parameters are ideal. Too few limits exploration; too many overwhelm users. Choose parameters that significantly affect the output and align with your algorithmic philosophy."
      },
      {
        "question": "What if my algorithm is too slow?",
        "answer": "Optimize by: reducing particle counts, simplifying calculations (avoid expensive sqrt/trig functions), using lookup tables, implementing spatial hashing for collisions, or reducing noise octaves. Test performance across different hardware."
