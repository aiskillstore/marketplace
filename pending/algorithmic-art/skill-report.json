    "faq": [
      {
        "question": "What's the difference between this and just asking Claude to create p5.js art?",
        "answer": "This skill follows a structured two-phase process: first creating an algorithmic philosophy (computational aesthetic framework), then implementing it with professional-grade templates, seeded randomness for reproducibility, and consistent Anthropic branding. It produces gallery-quality, exploration-ready artifacts, not just code snippets."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I customize the UI colors and layout?",
        "answer": "The Anthropic branding (fonts, colors, overall layout structure) should remain consistent. However, you can fully customize the algorithm, parameters, parameter controls, and whether to include color pickers. The art itself has complete creative freedom."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I generate variations of the same artwork?",
        "answer": "Every artifact includes seed navigation (Previous/Next/Random buttons and jump-to-seed input). Same seed always produces identical output, different seeds show variations. You can explore the seed space to find your favorite variations."
      },
      {
        "question": "What kind of algorithmic patterns can this create?",
        "answer": "Flow fields, particle systems, recursive structures, L-systems, Voronoi tessellations, circle packing, noise-based patterns, wave interference, fractal branching, organic growth simulations, and any other p5.js-compatible generative algorithm."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I use this for commercial projects or NFTs?",
        "answer": "The skill itself is Apache 2.0 licensed. The artworks you generate are yours, but ensure your algorithmic approach is original and doesn't copy existing artists' signature styles. The skill specifically emphasizes creating original work to avoid copyright issues."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I export the generated art?",
        "answer": "Each artifact can be saved as a complete HTML file that works standalone in any browser. For the canvas itself, you can take screenshots or implement PNG export functionality (saveCanvas in p5.js) through the provided template structure."
