      },
      {
        "question": "How do I ensure my algorithmic art is unique?",
        "answer": "Start with a custom algorithmic philosophy specific to your concept. The philosophy guides unique implementation choices. Avoid copying existing artists' techniques—focus on expressing your conceptual vision algorithmically."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I adjust the generated art after creation?",
        "answer": "Yes. The interactive HTML artifact includes real-time parameter controls (sliders, color pickers) and seed navigation (previous/next/random/jump). All changes regenerate the art instantly."
      },
      {
        "question": "What's the difference between seed and parameters?",
        "answer": "Seed determines the randomness pattern—same seed always produces identical output. Parameters control algorithmic behavior (particle count, flow speed, etc.). Together they enable full exploration of the art's possibility space."
      },
      {
        "question": "How performance-intensive are these artworks?",
        "answer": "Depends on particle count and algorithm complexity. The template provides reasonable defaults (5000 particles) for smooth 60fps performance on modern browsers. Adjust parameters down if experiencing lag."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I modify the generated HTML code?",
        "answer": "Yes, the artifact is self-contained HTML. You can edit it in any text editor to modify parameters, colors, algorithm logic, or UI controls. It requires no build process or dependencies beyond p5.js CDN."

        "question": "How do I download high-resolution versions?",
