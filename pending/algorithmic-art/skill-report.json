    "faq": [
      {
        "question": "What's the difference between algorithmic art and using filters on photos?",
        "answer": "Algorithmic art generates visual compositions entirely through code - mathematical relationships, noise functions, and particle behaviors. The beauty emerges from the computational process itself. Each run with a different seed produces a completely new, unique artwork. This is generative art, not image manipulation."
      },
      {
        "question": "Do I need to know advanced mathematics?",
        "answer": "You don't need graduate-level math, but comfort with basic concepts helps: vectors, noise functions (Perlin noise), trigonometry for angles/directions, and simple physics (force, velocity, acceleration). The skill guides you through the algorithmic philosophy first - the implementation follows from that vision."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I use this for commercial art projects?",
        "answer": "Yes. The Apache 2.0 license permits commercial use. You own the algorithmic philosophy and implementation. Just respect copyright if you reference other artists' work - embed references as algorithmic DNA, not literal copies."
      },
      {
        "question": "How many particles can I realistically handle?",
        "answer": "Modern browsers typically handle 10k-50k particles smoothly at 60fps depending on update complexity. Simple motion (following a field) handles larger counts. Complex inter-particle interactions (collision detection) require fewer. Test and optimize based on your specific algorithm."
      },
      {
        "question": "What if I want static (non-animated) art?",
        "answer": "Call noLoop() in setup() to generate once. The algorithm runs during setup, then draws the static result. Users can still explore variations by changing the seed."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I embed artistic concepts into the algorithm?",
        "answer": "The algorithmic philosophy describes your concept in computational terms. For example, 'neural networks' becomes: nodes as particles, connections as vectors, signal strength as color/opacity. The concept lives in the algorithm's behavior, not in the final image."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I use this skill to copy existing generative art?",
        "answer": "No - this skill emphasizes creating original algorithmic visions. Copying other artists' algorithms violates their intellectual property. Instead, develop your own computational philosophy and unique approach."
      },
      {
        "question": "What if the artifact runs slowly?",
        "answer": "Reduce particle count, simplify force calculations, or use spatial hashing for collision detection. Profile your code to find bottlenecks. Sometimes simpler algorithms can be more visually interesting than complex ones."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I make the art reproducible with seeds?",
        "answer": "Always call randomSeed(params.seed) and noiseSeed(params.seed) before generating. Then all random() and noise() calls will be deterministic. Same seed = identical output every time."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I share the HTML artifact without coding?",
        "answer": "The skill creates a self-contained HTML file you can save and email. Anyone with a browser can open it and explore - no installation needed. They can adjust parameters, navigate seeds, and export images."
