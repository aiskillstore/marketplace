      },
      {
        "question": "What format should I use for schema?",
        "answer": "Google recommends JSON-LD format for structured data. It is placed in script tags in the HTML head or body and is easier to implement and maintain than microdata."
      },
      {
        "question": "Will schema guarantee rich results?",
        "answer": "No. Schema markup makes your page eligible for rich results, but Google considers many factors including overall page quality, mobile-friendliness, and content relevance."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I test if my schema works?",
        "answer": "Use the Google Rich Results Test (search.google.com/test/rich-results) to validate your schema. You can also check schema.org/validator and monitor Search Console for enhancement reports."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I use multiple schema types on one page?",
        "answer": "Yes. You can use @graph to combine multiple schema types on one page. This is common for pages that need Organization, WebSite, and Article schema all connected."
      },
      {
        "question": "What happens if my schema has errors?",
        "answer": "Schema errors can prevent rich results from appearing. Fix errors promptly by checking Google's documentation for the specific schema type and ensure all required properties are included with valid values."
