Calculate exact sample size using Evan Miller's calculator\n2. Create mockups for both variants\n3. Implement in your testing tool\n4. QA both variants before launch"

The 18.8% relative improvement is both statistically significant and practically meaningful for your business.\n\n### Considerations\n- Consider running a full business cycle (2+ weeks) to account for day-of-week effects\n- Check if the lift is consistent across mobile and desktop\n- Monitor downstream metrics like activation rate"

    "faq": [
      {
        "question": "What is the minimum sample size for an A/B test?",
        "answer": "Sample size depends on your baseline conversion rate and the minimum effect you want to detect. For a 5% baseline with 20% lift, you need about 7,000 visitors per variant. Smaller baselines or smaller effects require much more traffic. Use online calculators like Evan Miller's to determine your specific needs."
      },
      {
        "question": "How long should I run an A/B test?",
        "answer": "Run tests for at least 1-2 full business cycles (1-2 weeks minimum) to account for day-of-week variation. Calculate duration based on your sample size needs. Avoid running tests too long as novelty effects and external factors can confound results."
      },
      {
        "question": "What makes a good A/B test hypothesis?",
        "answer": "A good hypothesis follows the format: Because [observation], we believe [change] will cause [outcome] for [audience]. We will know this is true when [metric]. It should be specific, testable, and include a clear success metric."
      },
      {
        "question": "When should I use multivariate testing instead of A/B testing?",
        "answer": "Use multivariate testing only when you have significant traffic (typically 100,000+ visitors per month) and want to test interactions between multiple variables. A/B testing is simpler, requires less traffic, and provides clearer results for most optimization efforts."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is statistical significance in A/B testing?",
        "answer": "Statistical significance indicates the probability that the difference between variants is not due to random chance. 95% significance means there is less than 5% chance the result is random. It does not guarantee the result is practically meaningful for your business."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I choose metrics for my A/B test?",
        "answer": "Select one primary metric directly tied to your hypothesis. Add secondary metrics to understand how the change affects behavior. Include guardrail metrics to ensure you do not harm important outcomes like revenue or user satisfaction."
