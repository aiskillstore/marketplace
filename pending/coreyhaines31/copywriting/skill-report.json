It's 9 AM your time, 6 PM theirs. You need an answer before tomorrow's standup, but your PM is offline. So you send another message, then another, hoping something sticks.\n\nBENEFITS SECTION: 1. See the full picture in one view - No more switching between Slack, email, and Trello to piece together what needs to get done. 2. Block time on everyone's calendar automatically - Respectful of time zones, not just yours. 3. Auto-status updates that actually work - Team members update their progress once; it flows to everyone who needs to know."
