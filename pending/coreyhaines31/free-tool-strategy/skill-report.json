      {
        "question": "What types of free tools work best for lead generation?",
        "answer": "Calculators work well for personalized results people share. Generators create tangible output worth bookmarking. Analyzers and auditors appeal to curiosity and create awareness of problems your product solves. The best choice depends on your audience's problems and how they connect to your product."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I validate a tool idea before investing in build?",
        "answer": "Research search demand using keyword tools. Check what existing solutions exist and identify how you could be different. Survey your target audience to confirm the problem matters to them. Calculate basic ROI using estimated lead values and rough build costs. Consider building a no-code prototype first to test interest."
      },
      {
        "question": "Should I gate my free tool behind an email wall?",
        "answer": "Gating decisions depend on your goals. Fully gated tools generate more leads but reduce usage and SEO value. Partially gated (email for full results) balances capture with reach. Ungated tools maximize traffic and brand awareness but generate fewer direct leads. Choose based on your primary objective."
      },
      {
        "question": "How long does it take to build a free marketing tool?",
        "answer": "Simple calculators or generators can be built in days using no-code tools. More complex tools with personalization and lead capture may take 2-4 weeks. Custom-built tools with unique functionality typically require 1-3 months. Start with an MVP to validate demand before investing in full development."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I promote a free tool once it is built?",
        "answer": "Announce to your email list and write a blog post about the tool. Submit to Product Hunt if applicable. Reach out to industry newsletters and publications. Create supporting content targeting the keywords the tool ranks for. Share interesting anonymized results on social media to demonstrate value."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I measure success for a free marketing tool?",

Measure conversion metrics including email captures, lead quality, and pipeline influenced. Survey new customers to attribute how many came through the tool."
