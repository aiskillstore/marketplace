        "question": "What is the best trigger for my popup?",

      {
        "question": "How often should I show popups to the same visitor?",

      },
      {
        "question": "Do popups hurt SEO?",
        "answer": "Google penalizes intrusive interstitials that block content on mobile. Cookie notices, age verification, and reasonable banners are fine. Avoid full-screen popups that appear before content on mobile devices."

      {
        "question": "What conversion rate should I expect?",
        "answer": "Typical benchmarks: Email popups 2-5%, Exit intent 3-10%, Click-triggered 10%+ (self-selected audience). Your results depend on offer relevance, timing, and traffic quality."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I make popups accessible?",
        "answer": "Ensure keyboard navigation (Tab, Enter, Esc to close). Use focus trapping while modal is open. Add ARIA labels for screen readers. Maintain color contrast ratios. Never rely on color alone to convey information."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I use the same popup on mobile and desktop?",
        "answer": "Not recommended. Mobile users have different behaviors and screen constraints. Use bottom slide-ups or full-width banners on mobile instead of center modals. Exit intent cannot be detected on mobile—use scroll depth or time-based triggers instead."
