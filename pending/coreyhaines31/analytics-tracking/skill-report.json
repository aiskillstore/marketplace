      {
        "question": "What is the difference between GA4 standard events and custom events?",
        "answer": "Standard events are predefined by Google with specific naming and parameters (like purchase, sign_up, login). They enable enhanced reporting features. Custom events are any events you define yourself. Use standard events when available for better analytics, and custom events for tracking specific business actions not covered by standard events."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I track events across web and mobile apps in GA4?",
        "answer": "Set up separate data streams for web and iOS/Android in GA4. Use the same event names across platforms for consistency. For mobile, implement Firebase SDK which sends data to GA4. Configure user properties to identify the same user across devices if applicable."
      },
      {
        "question": "What are enhanced measurement events in GA4?",
        "answer": "Enhanced measurement automatically tracks page views, scroll depth (90%), outbound clicks, site searches, video engagement, and file downloads. These are enabled by default on data streams. Review and adjust which events are tracked based on your privacy requirements and data needs."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I prevent PII from being tracked in analytics?",
        "answer": "Never send email addresses, names, phone numbers, or other directly identifying information in event parameters. Use user_id (a hash or pseudonymized identifier) instead. Implement GA4 Consent Mode to handle cookie consent requirements. Enable IP anonymization in GA4 settings."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is the difference between GTM and gtag.js for GA4?",
        "answer": "Gtag.js is a simple tagging script directly on pages. Google Tag Manager is a tag management system that lets you configure and deploy tags without modifying site code. GTM provides more flexibility for complex implementations, multiple tags, and team collaboration. For most implementations, GTM is recommended."
      },
      {
        "question": "How often should I review and audit my analytics tracking?",
        "answer": "Review tracking quarterly to ensure events still align with business goals. Audit after major site changes, new feature launches, or when data quality issues arise. Regular validation using DebugView and monitoring for duplicate events helps maintain data integrity over time."
