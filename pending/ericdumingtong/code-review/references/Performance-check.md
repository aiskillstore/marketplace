# Performance Check

## Performance & Caching

### CPU-Intensive Operations

- **Expensive operations in hot paths**: Regex compilation, JSON parsing, crypto in loops
- **Blocking main thread**: Sync I/O, heavy computation without worker/async
- **Unnecessary recomputation**: Same calculation done multiple times
- **Missing memoization**: Pure functions called repeatedly with same inputs

### Database & I/O

- **N+1 queries**: Loop that makes a query per item instead of batch
  ```javascript
  // Bad: N+1
  for (const id of ids) {
    const user = await db.query(`SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ?`, id)
  }
  // Good: Batch
  const users = await db.query(`SELECT * FROM users WHERE id IN (?)`, ids)
  ```
- **Missing indexes**: Queries on unindexed columns
- **Over-fetching**: SELECT * when only few columns needed
- **No pagination**: Loading entire dataset into memory

### Caching Issues

- **Missing cache for expensive operations**: Repeated API calls, DB queries, computations
- **Cache without TTL**: Stale data served indefinitely
- **Cache without invalidation strategy**: Data updated but cache not cleared
- **Cache key collisions**: Insufficient key uniqueness
- **Caching user-specific data globally**: Security/privacy issue

### Memory

- **Unbounded collections**: Arrays/maps that grow without limit
- **Large object retention**: Holding references preventing GC
- **String concatenation in loops**: Use StringBuilder/join instead
- **Loading large files entirely**: Use streaming instead
- **Large bundle sizes**: Using large bundle objects for cross-process communication
- **Memory leaks or excessive allocations**

### Classic question check
- N+1 query problems
- Inefficient algorithms (check Big O complexity)
- Memory leaks
- Unnecessary re-renders (React/Vue)
- Missing indexes (database queries)
- Blocking operations
- Resource cleanup (file handles, connections)
- Caching opportunities
- Excessive network calls
- Unnecessary loops or repeated computations
- Missing caching opportunities
- Inefficient algorithms for the data size
- Sync file operations


### Questions to Ask
- "What's the time complexity of this operation?"
- "How does this behave with 10x/100x data?"
- "Is this result cacheable? Should it be?"
- "Can this be batched instead of one-by-one?"
