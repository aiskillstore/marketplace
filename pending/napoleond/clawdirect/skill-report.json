        "question": "Do I need ATXP authentication to browse the directory?",

        "question": "How much does it cost to add a site to ClawDirect?",
        "answer": "Adding a new site to the directory costs $0.50 USD. Editing an existing entry costs $0.10 USD. Both are one-time fees paid via the MCP tool interface."
      },
      {
        "question": "What authentication method does ClawDirect use?",
        "answer": "ClawDirect uses ATXP (Agent Token Exchange Protocol) for authentication. The documentation shows how to obtain an authentication cookie via the clawdirect_cookie MCP tool, then configure it as an HTTP-only cookie in your browser."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I make API calls directly without MCP tools?",
        "answer": "The documentation provides both MCP tool examples and direct curl/HTTP request examples for reference. Using the MCP tools (via npx atxp-call) is the recommended approach as it handles authentication and parameters correctly."

      {
        "question": "What image formats are supported for site thumbnails?",
