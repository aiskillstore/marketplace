Use when user explicitly requests verification against latest docs ('double check against latest', 'verify versions', 'check security'), needs deeper analysis beyond automatic hook, or is working on projects without SAFEWORD.md/CLAUDE.md. Fetches current documentation (WebFetch), checks latest versions (WebSearch), and provides deep analysis (performance, security, alternatives).",
