## Core Insight

> "A startup is a temporary organization designed to search for a repeatable and scalable business model."

**Startups ≠ Small Versions of Big Companies:**
- Startups are SEARCHING for a business model
- Existing companies are EXECUTING a known business model
- Different rules apply to each

## The Customer Development Model (4 Steps)

| Step | Phase | Description |
|------|-------|-------------|
| **1. Customer Discovery** | Search | Turn hypotheses into facts by talking to customers |
| **2. Customer Validation** | Search | Prove repeatable, scalable business model exists |
| **3. Customer Creation** | Execute | Build end-user demand, scale acquisition |
| **4. Company Building** | Execute | Transition from startup to company |

## The #1 Rule: Get Out of the Building

> "Facts live outside the building, where future customers live and work."

Founders must do this personally—cannot be delegated to employees or consultants.

## Search vs Execute

| Search Mode | Execute Mode |
|-------------|--------------|
| Hypotheses, testing, learning | Plans, forecasts, metrics |
| Customer Development Team | Functional departments |
| "Learning and discovery" culture | "Fear of failure" culture |
| Pivot when hypotheses wrong | Fire people when plans fail |

## Key Concepts

| Concept | Definition |
|---------|------------|
| **Pivot** | Substantive change to one or more business model components |
| **Iteration** | Minor adjustment to business model |
| **MVP** | Minimum Viable Product - smallest feature set to learn from |
| **Earlyvangelists** | Visionary customers who buy unfinished products |
| **Product/Market Fit** | Business model matches customer segment needs |

## The 9 Deadly Sins of Product Introduction

1. Assuming "I know what the customer wants"
2. The "I know what features to build" flaw
3. Focus on launch date over customer learning
4. Emphasis on execution instead of hypothesis testing
5. Business plans presume no trial and no errors
6. Confusing job titles with what a startup needs
7. Sales and marketing execute to a plan (no iteration)
8. Presumption of success leads to premature scaling
9. Management by crisis leads to a death spiral

## 4 Market Types

| Market Type | Strategy |
|-------------|----------|
| **Existing Market** | Compete on features, faster/better/cheaper |
| **New Market** | Create demand, educate customers |
| **Re-segmented (Low-cost)** | "Good enough" at lower price |
| **Re-segmented (Niche)** | Specialized for underserved segment |

## Quarterly Review Questions

- Are we searching or executing? (Be honest)
- What hypotheses have we tested this quarter?
- How much time did founders spend outside the building?
- Have we achieved product/market fit?
- What did we learn from failures?
- Are we pivoting based on data or gut feelings?
- What market type are we in?
