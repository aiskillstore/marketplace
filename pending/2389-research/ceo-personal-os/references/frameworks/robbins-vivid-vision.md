# Tony Robbins Vivid Vision

## Core Concept

Write a detailed description of your life 3 years from now, in present tense, as if you're already living it.

## Requirements

- **Present tense** - "I am..." not "I will..."
- **3 years out** - Close enough to feel real, far enough for significant change
- **All life domains** - Career, relationships, health, finances, lifestyle
- **Emotionally compelling** - Should excite you when you read it
- **Specific details** - What you see, feel, experience daily

## Structure

### A Typical Day
Describe waking up, your morning, work, relationships, evening, how you feel throughout.

### Life Domains
- **Professional** - Role, impact, team, accomplishments
- **Relationships** - Partner, family, friends, community
- **Health** - Energy, fitness, mental state
- **Financial** - Security, freedom, what money enables
- **Lifestyle** - Where you live, how you spend time
- **Contribution** - How you help others, legacy

## Usage

- Write it once, refine quarterly
- Read it weekly or when making big decisions
- Use it as a filter: "Does this move me toward my vision?"
