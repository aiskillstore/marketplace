## The Buyback Principle

> "Don't hire to grow your business. Hire to buy back your time."

## The Buyback Loop (Audit-Transfer-Fill)

1. **Audit** - What tasks drain you that are easy/inexpensive to delegate?
2. **Transfer** - Who can take these over (better suited, enjoys them)?
3. **Fill** - What high-value work should you do instead?

Repeat continuously to upgrade your time.

## The Pain Line

The point where growth becomes impossible because:
- More business growth = more pain
- You'll subconsciously sabotage growth to avoid pain

**Three Ways Entrepreneurs Self-Destruct:**

| Response | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Sell** | Desperate to exit, sell on bad terms |
| **Sabotage** | Subconsciously make bad decisions to stay small |
| **Stall** | Consciously decide not to grow (slow death) |

## The DRIP Matrix

| | Low $ Value | High $ Value |
|---|---|---|
| **Draining** | Delegate | Replace |
| **Energizing** | Invest | Production |

Focus on the **Production Quadrant**: High value + Energizing work.

## Buyback Rate

- Calculate your effective hourly rate
- Anything below that rate should be delegated
- Example: If you make $200/hr effective, delegate anything done for $50/hr

## The 5 Time Assassins

1. **The Staller** (perfectionism)
2. **The Speed Demon** (rushing without thinking)
3. **The Supervisor** (micromanaging)
4. **The Saver** (hoarding tasks)
5. **The Self-Medicator** (vices to cope)

## Perfect Week Design

- Design your ideal week in advance
- Block time for high-value activities
- Protect creative/strategic time
- Build in recovery
