## Level 5 Leadership

| Level | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Level 5** | Executive who builds enduring greatness through personal humility and professional will |
| **Level 4** | Effective Leader - catalyzes commitment to clear, compelling vision |
| **Level 3** | Competent Manager - organizes people and resources efficiently |
| **Level 2** | Contributing Team Member - contributes to group objectives |
| **Level 1** | Highly Capable Individual - productive through talent and knowledge |

**Level 5 Paradox:** Ambitious for the cause, not themselves. Ferociously determined yet humble.

## First Who, Then What

1. Get the right people on the bus
2. Get the wrong people off the bus
3. Get the right people in the right seats
4. THEN figure out where to drive

## The Hedgehog Concept (Three Circles)

What lies at the intersection of:
1. **Passion** - What are you deeply passionate about?
2. **Best At** - What can you be the best in the world at?
3. **Economic Engine** - What drives your resource engine?

## Stockdale Paradox

> "You must maintain unwavering faith that you can and will prevail in the end, regardless of the difficulties, AND at the same time have the discipline to confront the most brutal facts of your current reality."

## The Flywheel

- No single breakthrough moment
- Consistent pushing in an intelligent direction
- Momentum builds turn by turn
- Results attract resources → stronger organization → better results → more resources

## Culture of Discipline

- **Disciplined people** - Don't need hierarchy
- **Disciplined thought** - Confront brutal facts
- **Disciplined action** - Aligned to Hedgehog Concept

## Quarterly Review Questions

- Am I operating at Level 5 (humble + determined)?
- Do I have the right people on the bus?
- Am I clear on my Hedgehog Concept?
- Am I confronting brutal facts while maintaining faith?
- Is the flywheel building momentum?
