## The E-Myth (Entrepreneurial Myth)

> "The fatal assumption: If you understand the technical work of a business, you understand a business that does that technical work."

This is FALSE. A great baker does not necessarily make a great bakery owner.

## Three Personas in Every Business Owner

| Persona | Focus | Wants |
|---------|-------|-------|
| **The Entrepreneur** | Future vision, dreams | Change, innovation |
| **The Manager** | Order, systems, control | Predictability, planning |
| **The Technician** | Present work, doing | Getting things done |

Most small business owners are 10% Entrepreneur, 20% Manager, 70% Technician.

## The Entrepreneurial Seizure

The moment when a technician thinks: "Why am I working for this person? I could do this myself!"

Then starts a business and immediately becomes enslaved by it—because they're still just a technician, now with 10 more jobs they don't know how to do.

## Work ON Your Business, Not IN It

| Working IN | Working ON |
|------------|------------|
| Doing the technical work | Building systems |
| Reacting to problems | Designing processes |
| Being indispensable | Creating replaceability |
| Trading time for money | Building scalable value |

## The Turn-Key Revolution (Franchise Prototype)

Build your business as if you were going to franchise it:
- Systems run the business
- People run the systems
- Document everything
- Make it work without you

## Business Development Process

1. **Innovation** - Continuous improvement
2. **Quantification** - Measure everything important
3. **Orchestration** - Eliminate discretion at operating level

## The Three Phases of Business

| Phase | Description | Problem |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| **Infancy** | Technician's phase, owner does everything | Burns out |
| **Adolescence** | Gets help but abdicates management | Chaos when growth hits |
| **Maturity** | Entrepreneurial perspective, systems-driven | Sustainable |

## Quarterly Review Questions

- Am I working ON or IN the business?
- What's my Entrepreneur/Manager/Technician balance?
- Could someone run this business from a manual?
- What systems need to be built or documented?
- Am I building a business or just creating a job?
