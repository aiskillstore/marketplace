Move detailed patterns, advanced techniques, comprehensive API docs, and extensive examples to references/. SKILL.md content loads when the skill triggers; references/ load only when Claude needs them."

      {
        "question": "How do I write good trigger descriptions?",

Include specific phrases users would say in quotes: 'create a hook', 'validate settings', 'configure MCP'. Be concrete, not vague. List multiple trigger scenarios. Study plugin-dev skills for examples."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why imperative form instead of second person?",
        "answer": "Imperative form ('Configure the server', 'Validate input') is clearer and more direct than second person ('You should configure...') for AI consumption. It maintains consistency, reduces word count, and focuses on what to do rather than who does it."

      {
        "question": "Do plugin skills need packaging?",

        "question": "How long should my skill description be?",
        "answer": "The description should be 1-3 sentences. Start with 'This skill should be used when...' then list specific trigger phrases. Be comprehensive but concise. The description determines when Claude loads your skill, so specificity matters more than length."
