Use it when entering a new market, evaluating industry dynamics, or assessing strategic positioning. The five forces are: threat of new entrants, supplier power, buyer power, threat of substitutes, and competitive rivalry."

        "question": "How is Blue Ocean Strategy different from competitive analysis?",

      {
        "question": "What makes a good positioning map?",
        "answer": "A good positioning map uses two dimensions that matter to customers, plots all relevant competitors, and clearly identifies white space. The dimensions should be independent (not correlated) and represent genuine customer choice criteria."

      {
        "question": "How do I identify sustainable competitive advantages?",
        "answer": "Sustainable advantages include network effects, high switching costs, economies of scale, brand equity, proprietary technology, and regulatory protection. Test sustainability by asking: Can competitors copy this in under two years? Does it matter to customers? Do we execute it better than anyone else?"
      },
      {
        "question": "Does this skill provide real competitor data?",
        "answer": "No, this skill provides frameworks and templates for analysis. You need to gather competitor information from public sources, research, and customer feedback. The skill structures your analysis but does not retrieve or validate competitive intelligence."
      },
      {
        "question": "How often should I update competitive analysis?",
        "answer": "Update competitive analysis regularly based on your market dynamics. Weekly monitoring of competitor product changes and news is recommended for fast-moving markets. Monthly positioning reviews and quarterly deep-dive analyses are standard practice for most businesses."
