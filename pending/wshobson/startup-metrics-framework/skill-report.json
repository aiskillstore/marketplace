    "faq": [
      {
        "question": "What is the Rule of 40 and why does it matter?",
        "answer": "The Rule of 40 states that a company's revenue growth rate plus profit margin should exceed 40%. It is a benchmark used by investors to evaluate the balance between growth and profitability, especially at Series B+ stage. A score above 40% is excellent, 20-40% is acceptable, and below 20% needs improvement."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is a good LTV:CAC ratio for startups?",
        "answer": "A healthy LTV:CAC ratio is greater than 3.0, meaning customers generate three times the cost to acquire them. Ratios between 1.0-3.0 need improvement, and anything below 1.0 is unsustainable. The ratio should account for gross margin and customer lifetime."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I calculate runway for my startup?",
        "answer": "Runway is calculated by dividing your cash balance by your monthly net burn rate. For example, $3 million in cash divided by $150,000 monthly burn equals 20 months of runway. Maintain 12-18 months runway as a target to ensure sufficient time for fundraising or achieving profitability."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is Net Dollar Retention (NDR) and why is it important?",
        "answer": "NDR measures revenue retained from existing customers including expansion, minus contraction and churn, expressed as a percentage. NDR above 100% indicates your existing customers are growing. Benchmarks: above 120% is best-in-class, 100-120% is good, below 100% needs improvement."
      },
      {
        "question": "How does burn multiple differ from burn rate?",
        "answer": "Burn rate is the absolute amount of cash spent monthly. Burn multiple measures efficiency by comparing net burn to net new ARR - it shows how much you spend to generate each dollar of revenue. A burn multiple below 1.0 means you are generating more ARR than you are burning."
      },
      {
        "question": "Which metrics should I prioritize at pre-seed stage?",
        "answer": "At pre-seed (product-market fit), focus on active user growth, user retention (Day 7 and Day 30), core engagement metrics, and qualitative feedback. Do not worry about revenue, CAC optimization, or detailed unit economics - these become important at later stages."
