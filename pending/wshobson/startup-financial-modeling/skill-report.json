    "best_practices": [
      "Use conservative assumptions - startups rarely hit aggressive projections on day one",
      "Include 20% buffer to expense estimates for unexpected costs",
      "Model cash flow separately from revenue (payment terms affect runway)",
      "Always include three scenarios - conservative, base, and optimistic",
      "Validate your model against industry benchmarks and comparable companies"
    ],
    "anti_patterns": [
      "Don't assume flat growth rates - customer acquisition typically follows S-curve patterns",
      "Don't ignore churn - even good startups lose customers over time",
      "Don't calculate runway based on revenue instead of cash received (payment terms matter)",

    "faq": [
      {
        "question": "What's the difference between burn rate and runway?",
        "answer": "Burn rate is your monthly net cash loss (revenue minus expenses). Runway is how many months of cash you have remaining before running out of money, calculated as current cash balance divided by monthly burn rate."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I calculate customer retention rate?",
        "answer": "Retention rate is the percentage of customers who continue paying each month. For example, if you start with 100 customers and end the month with 95, your retention rate is 95%. Track retention by cohort to see how retention improves or degrades over time."
      },
      {
        "question": "What's a good LTV/CAC ratio for startups?",
        "answer": "A healthy LTV/CAC ratio is typically 3:1 or higher. This means a customer is worth three times what you spent to acquire them. Below 3:1, your customer acquisition is too expensive and your business model may not be sustainable."
      },
      {
        "question": "How long should my financial model cover?",
        "answer": "Build detailed monthly projections for the first 2 years, and quarterly for year 3. Use annual projections for years 4-5. This gives enough detail for planning while remaining realistic about uncertainty."
      },
      {
        "question": "What's the Rule of 40 for startups?",
        "answer": "The Rule of 40 states that a software startup's growth rate plus profit margin should equal or exceed 40%. For example, a 30% growth rate with 10% margins (or 20% growth with 20% margins) is meeting the rule. It's a simple benchmark for growth-stage startups."
      },
      {
        "question": "How much should I raise in my funding round?",
        "answer": "Raise enough to extend your runway 18-24 months plus achieve your next major milestone. Many founders raise 6-9 months of runway. Ensure you have enough to execute your plan without constant fundraising distractions."
