      {
        "question": "What's the difference between fillable and non-fillable forms?",
        "answer": "Fillable forms have embedded form field definitions that can be programmatically set. Non-fillable forms are just static images/text, requiring you to identify bounding boxes visually and add text annotations on top."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why do my bounding boxes need validation?",
        "answer": "Validation ensures label and entry bounding boxes don't overlap and that entry boxes are tall enough for the text. The validation images show blue (label) and red (entry) rectangles so you can visually verify correct placement before filling the form."

      {
        "question": "Can this skill handle scanned PDFs?",
