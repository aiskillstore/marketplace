        "question": "Can this skill handle scanned PDFs or image-based PDFs?",

        "question": "What's the difference between fillable and non-fillable form filling?",

        "question": "How accurate is table extraction from PDFs?",

      {
        "question": "Can I extract specific pages from a PDF?",
