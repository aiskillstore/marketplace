    "faq": [
      {
        "question": "How do I fill out a PDF form?",
        "answer": "Read forms.md completely first. The process differs based on whether the PDF has fillable fields. Run check_fillable_fields.py to determine the type. For fillable forms, extract field info, create a field_values.json, and use fill_fillable_fields.py. For non-fillable forms, convert to images, analyze visually, create bounding boxes in fields.json, validate them, then use fill_pdf_form_with_annotations.py."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can this extract tables from PDFs?",
        "answer": "Yes, use pdfplumber's extract_tables() method. It handles most table layouts well and can export to pandas DataFrames. For complex tables, adjust extraction settings like vertical_strategy and snap_tolerance. The reference.md file contains advanced examples."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I handle scanned PDFs?",
        "answer": "Scanned PDFs are images and require OCR. Install pytesseract and pdf2image, convert the PDF to images with convert_from_path(), then use pytesseract.image_to_string() on each image. See the 'Extract Text from Scanned PDFs' section in SKILL.md."
      },
      {
        "question": "What's the difference between pypdf and pdfplumber?",
        "answer": "pypdf is for basic operations (merge, split, rotate, metadata). pdfplumber excels at text and table extraction with layout awareness. Use pypdf for document manipulation, pdfplumber for content extraction."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I password-protect generated PDFs?",
        "answer": "Yes, use pypdf's writer.encrypt() method with user and owner passwords. See the 'Password Protection' example in SKILL.md. To remove passwords, use qpdf with --decrypt flag."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why do my form annotations look wrong in some PDF viewers?",
        "answer": "PDF viewers render annotations differently. Preview.app on macOS has known issues with form fields. Always test in multiple viewers (Chrome, Firefox, Adobe Acrobat). Font size and color may not work consistently across all viewers due to PDF specification limitations."
