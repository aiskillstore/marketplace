        "question": "How does this skill differ from generic UI generation?",

      },
      {
        "question": "What are surface tokens and why do they matter?",
        "answer": "Surface tokens define elevation hierarchy through subtle color shifts. Professional interfaces use barely-visible differences between levels so hierarchy emerges without demanding attention."
      },
      {
        "question": "How should I handle dark mode?",
        "answer": "Lean on borders over shadows since shadows are less visible on dark backgrounds. Adjust semantic colors to be slightly desaturated. The hierarchy system stays the same but values invert."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is system.md and how do I use it?",
        "answer": "system.md is a memory file that saves patterns, measurements, and design decisions. Update it when you create reusable components or establish conventions. Future work should reference and extend existing patterns."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I create a unique interface identity?",
        "answer": "Through the signature element requirement. Every design must include one element that could only exist for that specific product. Combine this with domain exploration and color world mapping to avoid generic output."
