        "question": "Does Agentation work in production?",

        "question": "Which Next.js router types are supported?",

      {
        "question": "What are the requirements for using Agentation?",

      {
        "question": "How do I know if Agentation is working?",

      },
      {
        "question": "Can I customize when Agentation appears?",
        "answer": "Yes, you can modify the conditional rendering logic. The default setup uses process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development' but you can adjust this to any condition that fits your workflow."
