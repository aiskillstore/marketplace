        "question": "Which genomes are supported?",

        "question": "Can I use geniml with scanpy?",

      },
      {
        "question": "Is my data safe with geniml?",
        "answer": "Geniml processes data locally. No data is sent to external servers. All operations run on your machine using your specified input files."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why are my embeddings not converging?",
        "answer": "Check learning rate (try 0.01-0.05), increase epochs, and validate data quality. Ensure your universe file covers your regions and tokenization coverage is sufficient."
      },
      {
        "question": "How does geniml compare to other tools?",
