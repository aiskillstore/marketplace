  "description": "Digital pathology image processing toolkit for whole slide images (WSI). Use this skill when working with histopathology slides, processing H&E or IHC stained tissue images, extracting tiles from gigapixel pathology images, detecting tissue regions, segmenting tissue masks, or preparing datasets for computational pathology deep learning pipelines. Applies to WSI formats (SVS, TIFF, NDPI), tile-based analysis, and histological image preprocessing workflows.",
