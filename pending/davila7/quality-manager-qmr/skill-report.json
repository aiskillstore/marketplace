It does not replace the legal designation of a QMR within your organization, which carries specific regulatory accountability under frameworks like EU MDR and FDA QSR. The skill should be used as a support tool by or under the supervision of your designated QMR."

      {
        "question": "Can this skill help me prepare for both FDA and EU MDR compliance?",
        "answer": "Yes, the skill covers multi-jurisdictional regulatory compliance including FDA QSR 21 CFR 820, EU MDR 2017/745, and ISO 13485 certification requirements. It provides frameworks for understanding requirements across jurisdictions, but you should always verify specific compliance requirements against current official regulatory guidance and consult with regulatory affairs specialists for your specific products and markets."
      },
      {
        "question": "How often should I use this skill for quality management activities?",
        "answer": "For optimal results, integrate the skill into regular quality management cycles: before management reviews for preparation support, during audit preparation for readiness assessments, when developing quality strategy for frameworks and best practices, and periodically for compliance gap analysis. Consistent use helps build institutional knowledge and improves the quality of guidance over time."
      },
      {
        "question": "Does this skill provide real-time regulatory updates?",
        "answer": "No, the skill does not provide real-time regulatory intelligence or automatic updates on regulatory changes. Regulatory requirements and guidance evolve continuously. You should monitor official regulatory authority sources (FDA, EUDAMED, Notified Bodies, etc.) for the latest updates and consult with regulatory affairs professionals for interpretation and impact assessment on your quality management system."
