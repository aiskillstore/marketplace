      {
        "question": "How do I check if my data meets normality assumptions?",
        "answer": "Use Shapiro-Wilk test for small samples (n < 50), visual Q-Q plots for all sample sizes, and examine histograms. For large samples (n > 100), rely primarily on visual inspection."

      {
        "question": "When should I use non-parametric tests instead of t-tests?",

      {
        "question": "How do I handle multiple comparisons in my analysis?",

      },
      {
        "question": "What effect size should I report for different tests?",
        "answer": "Report Cohen's d for t-tests, eta-squared or partial eta-squared for ANOVA, r for correlations, R-squared for regression, and Cramer's V for chi-square tests. Always include confidence intervals."

      {
        "question": "When should I use Bayesian instead of frequentist methods?",
