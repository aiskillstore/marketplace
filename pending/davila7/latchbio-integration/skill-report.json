        "answer": "Tasks can use CPU cores up to 96, memory up to 768GB, and GPUs including K80, V100, and A100. Use @small_task, @large_task, @small_gpu_task, @large_gpu_task, or @custom_task for specific configurations."

      {
        "question": "How do I integrate Latch workflows with external tools?",

        "question": "Why is my workflow registration failing?",
