  "description": "This skill should be used at the start of any computationally intensive scientific task to detect and report available system resources (CPU cores, GPUs, memory, disk space). It creates a JSON file with resource information and strategic recommendations that inform computational approach decisions such as whether to use parallel processing (joblib, multiprocessing), out-of-core computing (Dask, Zarr), GPU acceleration (PyTorch, JAX), or memory-efficient strategies. Use this skill before running analyses, training models, processing large datasets, or any task where resource constraints matter.",
