      {
        "question": "How do I handle authentication in tests?",
        "answer": "Use page.fill() to enter credentials, or set browser storage cookies using page.context.storage_state() to reuse sessions."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is my test data safe?",

      },
      {
        "question": "Why are my tests failing on dynamic apps?",
        "answer": "Most failures occur because scripts inspect DOM before JavaScript completes. Always use page.wait_for_load_state('networkidle') first."

        "question": "How is this different from Selenium?",
