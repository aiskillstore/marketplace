    "faq": [
      {
        "question": "What is the difference between box plots and violin plots in seaborn?",
        "answer": "Box plots show summary statistics (median, quartiles, outliers) as a box with whiskers. Violin plots show the full distribution shape using kernel density estimation, making them better for understanding data distribution beyond summary statistics."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I use seaborn with data stored in pandas DataFrames?",
        "answer": "Yes, seaborn is designed for pandas integration. Pass the DataFrame to functions along with column names for x, y, and hue parameters. Seaborn automatically handles data access from the DataFrame."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I save seaborn figures for publication?",
        "answer": "Use matplotlib's savefig function after creating your seaborn plot. Set dpi=300 for high resolution, specify the format (PNG, PDF, SVG) in the filename, and adjust figure size before saving."
      },
      {
        "question": "What color palettes are available in seaborn?",
        "answer": "Seaborn provides named palettes like 'deep', 'muted', 'pastel', 'bright', 'dark', and 'colorblind'. You can also create custom palettes using sns.color_palette() with specific colors or using built-in palettes like 'husl' or 'cubehelix'."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I customize seaborn figure styling globally?",
        "answer": "Use sns.set_theme() or sns.set_style(), sns.set_context(), and sns.set_palette() to control the theme, plotting context (paper, talk, poster), and color palette across all figures in your session."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I combine matplotlib and seaborn in the same figure?",
        "answer": "Yes, seaborn returns matplotlib axes objects that can be customized with matplotlib functions. You can add annotations, modify axis limits, or layer additional plots using standard matplotlib commands on seaborn-generated axes."
