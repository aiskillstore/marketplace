The 'external_commands' detections are legitimate documentation examples showing command-line workflows (creating directories, running Chrome headless, using LibreOffice). The 'weak cryptographic algorithm' findings are pattern-based false positives triggered by words like 'md5sum' and 'sha' in PDF quality checking documentation. The 'system reconnaissance' findings are standard PDF analysis commands (pdfinfo, pdffonts, pdfimages) used for poster quality validation. The 'certificate/key files' detection is triggered by CSS linear-gradient syntax patterns. No actual dangerous code execution, credential access, or malicious patterns exist.",
