    "description": "This skill should be used at the start of any computationally intensive scientific task to detect and report available system resources (CPU cores, GPUs, memory, disk space). It creates a JSON file with resource information and strategic recommendations that inform computational approach decisions such as whether to use parallel processing (joblib, multiprocessing), out-of-core computing (Dask, Zarr), GPU acceleration (PyTorch, JAX), or memory-efficient strategies. Use this skill before running analyses, training models, processing large datasets, or any task where resource constraints matter.",

The skill performs legitimate system resource detection using subprocess calls to standard system utilities (nvidia-smi, rocm-smi, sysctl, system_profiler) for GPU/CPU detection. All subprocess commands use hardcoded arguments in list format, preventing shell injection. The __import__ usage is for importing the standard datetime module. Markdown backticks triggered false positives for shell execution. 'Weak cryptographic algorithm' findings are scanner errors on non-cryptographic code.",
