      {
        "question": "Can this skill help with interdisciplinary projects?",
        "answer": "Yes. The skill explicitly draws parallels across scientific domains and uses techniques like Biomimicry and cross-domain analogies to connect ideas from different fields."
      },
      {
        "question": "How long should a brainstorming session last?",
        "answer": "A productive session typically runs 30 to 60 minutes. The skill guides researchers through five phases: context understanding, divergent exploration, connection making, critical evaluation, and synthesis of next steps."

      {
        "question": "Does this skill work with all Claude models?",

      {
        "question": "How do I integrate this with my existing research workflow?",
        "answer": "Use the skill during planning phases before experiments begin. The output of each session should be concrete next steps such as literature searches, pilot experiments, or collaboration opportunities."

      {
        "question": "When should I not use this skill?",
        "answer": "Avoid this skill when you already have specific hypotheses to test or when you need data analysis. For hypothesis formulation from existing data, consider using the hypothesis-generation skill instead."
