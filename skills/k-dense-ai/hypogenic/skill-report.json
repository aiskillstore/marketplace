After evaluation, all findings are false positives: environment variable references for API keys follow security best practices; hardcoded URLs are legitimate documentation links; shell command examples are user setup instructions; no actual cryptographic code or command-and-control patterns exist. The skill makes normal LLM API calls for hypothesis generation, which is expected functionality.",
