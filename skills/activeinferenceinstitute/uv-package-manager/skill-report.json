      {
        "question": "Is uv compatible with existing pip and poetry projects?",

      {
        "question": "How much faster is uv compared to pip?",
        "answer": "uv is typically 10-100x faster than pip depending on the operation. Installation speed improvements come from parallel downloads, a global cache, and Rust-based performance optimizations."
      },
      {
        "question": "Does uv require Python to be installed?",
        "answer": "No, uv can install Python interpreters for you. The uv binary is standalone and written in Rust, so it does not require an existing Python installation."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I use uv in CI/CD pipelines?",
        "answer": "Yes, uv is excellent for CI/CD. Use the astral-sh/setup-uv action for GitHub Actions, or install via curl/pip in other systems. The --frozen flag ensures exact lockfile reproduction."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is the difference between uv add and uv pip install?",
        "answer": "uv add modifies your pyproject.toml and manages project dependencies, while uv pip install is a pip-compatible command for one-off installations. Use uv add for project dependencies and uv pip for quick testing."

      {
        "question": "How do I handle private package repositories with uv?",
        "answer": "Configure custom package sources in pyproject.toml under the [tool.uv.sources] section. You can specify git repositories, local paths, or custom index URLs for private packages."
