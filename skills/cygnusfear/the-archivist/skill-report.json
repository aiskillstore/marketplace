    "faq": [
      {
        "question": "When should I write a full ADR versus a brief decision entry?",
        "answer": "Use full ADRs for architectural decisions that affect multiple modules, have high reversal cost, or require stakeholder input. Brief entries work for module-level decisions with moderate impact. The skill includes a decision tree to help classify choices."
      },
      {
        "question": "How does this integrate with Claude Code workflows?",
        "answer": "The Archivist activates during code implementation when you make technical choices. It provides templates and guidance but requires manual execution. It works alongside planning and code review skills to ensure decisions are documented."
      },
      {
        "question": "Do I need to document every single code decision?",
        "answer": "No. Trivial choices like variable names, standard framework patterns, and language idioms do not need formal documentation. Focus on decisions where forgetting the rationale would cause problems or where reasonable alternatives existed."
      },
      {
        "question": "What if our team already has ADR templates?",
        "answer": "The templates provided are MADR-inspired and can be customized. The core value is the decision detection triggers and enforcement protocol, which work with any ADR format your team prefers."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I handle decisions that were made before using this skill?",
        "answer": "You can retroactively document important historical decisions, but mark them clearly with the actual decision date and note they are retrospective. Focus on documenting new decisions prospectively for best results."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can this skill automatically detect undocumented decisions in my code?",
        "answer": "No, it provides manual checklists and review guidelines. You must actively identify decisions during implementation and code review. The skill offers detection triggers and questions to help identify what needs documentation."
