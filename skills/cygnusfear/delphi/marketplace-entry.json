  "description": "This skill should be used when the user asks to \"use delphi\", \"ask delphi\", or wants multiple parallel oracle investigations of the same question to discover divergent insights. Delphi launches multiple oracle agents simultaneously with identical prompts, allowing them to independently explore and potentially discover different paths, clues, and solutions. Results are saved to .oracle/[topic]/ and synthesized into a final document.",
