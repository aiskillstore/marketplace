      "Do not mark a plan as complete based only on plan step completion without verifying the original issue requirements are fully addressed",

    "faq": [
      {
        "question": "What is a removal specification and why is it important?",
        "answer": "A removal specification lists old code, deprecated functions, and files that should be deleted as part of a refactoring or migration. Verifying removals is critical because leftover old code can cause bugs, confusion, and maintenance burden."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can this skill automatically fix issues it finds?",
        "answer": "No, this skill is read-only and performs auditing only. It identifies issues and generates task lists, but does not modify code. This separation ensures audit integrity and prevents unintended changes."
      },
      {
        "question": "What does original issue coverage verification check?",
        "answer": "It compares the implementation against the requirements from the original GitHub issue or task that triggered the plan. This catches cases where the plan itself was incomplete and missed some requirements from the original request."
      },
      {
        "question": "How does the skill calculate completion percentage?",
        "answer": "Completion is calculated as completed plan steps divided by total plan steps. A weighted completion metric also counts partially complete steps as 0.5 to give a more nuanced progress view."
      },
      {
        "question": "What validation checks does this skill run?",
        "answer": "The skill runs TypeScript type checking, linting, and build verification if applicable. It also checks for strict typing compliance by detecting any types and verifies adherence to project coding guidelines."
      },
      {
        "question": "Where are the detailed progress reports saved?",
        "answer": "Detailed reports are saved as markdown files in the plans directory with the naming pattern plan-name.progress.md. These reports include step-by-step status, quality assessments, and remaining work."
