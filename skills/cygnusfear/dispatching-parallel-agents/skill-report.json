      {

      },
      {
        "question": "What happens if parallel agents edit the same files?",
        "answer": "Review agent summaries after completion to identify conflicts. If agents edited same code sections, manually integrate changes or re-run one agent with context from the other. This is rare with proper problem domain identification."
      },
      {
        "question": "How many agents can I dispatch in parallel?",
        "answer": "Dispatch one agent per independent problem domain. Typical range is 2 to 6 agents. More agents provide diminishing returns if problems are not truly independent or if review time exceeds parallel execution benefits."
      },
      {
        "question": "Should I use this for exploratory debugging?",
        "answer": "No. Parallel dispatch requires knowing what is broken and that problems are independent. For exploratory debugging where problem scope is unknown, use single agent investigation first to map out issues."
      },
      {
        "question": "How detailed should agent prompts be?",
        "answer": "Provide focused scope, complete context including error messages, clear constraints on what not to change, and specific output format. Good prompts are self-contained so agents need no additional information."
      },
      {
        "question": "What if one agent fails to complete its task?",
        "answer": "Review the agent summary to understand what blocked it. You can dispatch a new agent with refined instructions, or handle that problem domain manually after integrating fixes from successful agents."
