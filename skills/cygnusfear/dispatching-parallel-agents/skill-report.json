      {
        "question": "How do I verify results don't conflict?",

      {
        "question": "What if agents return conflicting changes?",
        "answer": "Review each summary, identify the conflict, and resolve manually. The skill recommends spot-checking and running full test suites to catch conflicts."

      {
        "question": "How is this different from sequential agent use?",
        "answer": "Sequential agents wait for each other to finish. Parallel agents work simultaneously, reducing total time when problems are truly independent."
