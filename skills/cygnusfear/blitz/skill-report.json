      {
        "question": "How does the 100% coverage gate work?",
        "answer": "Before merging any PR, create a line-by-line table matching each requirement from the original GitHub issue to implementation evidence. Only PRs with all requirements marked as complete can proceed to merge."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why sequential merge instead of parallel merge?",
        "answer": "Sequential squash-merge with rebase between each PR catches integration issues early and keeps main history linear. Parallel merges create difficult conflict resolution scenarios."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I use blitz without the Delphi skill?",

      {
        "question": "What git version is required?",

        "question": "Do the review scores appear in GitHub UI?",
