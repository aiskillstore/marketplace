The space agency, everyone...'\n\nShe gestures to the fried circuitry. 'The long-range communication array was destroyed in the crash. But maybe... maybe I can fix it.'\n\n'We would need an antenna array, a signal amplifier, and a power source. And ideally, we would build the tower on that hill five kilometers away for better transmission range.'\n\nIts a huge project. It could take a week or more. And theres no guarantee it will work...'\n\nShe looks at you, searching for hope. 'But is it worth trying? What do you think?'"

'If I arrange them in a specific geometric pattern, they could amplify the signal even better than metal antennas!'\n\nShe begins sketching a design. 'We could combine them with salvaged Earth technology - this is improvisational engineering at its finest!'\n\n'Come on, lets gather more and bring them back to camp. This could actually work!'"

I survived a magnetic storm and crashed on an unknown planet.'\n\nShe pauses, then continues more softly. 'I dont have exact coordinates - this planet is not on any of our star maps. But I can describe it. Dual star system. G2 primary star. Oxygen atmosphere. Water. Life.'\n\nHer voice catches. 'I survived... and I want my family to know Im alive.'\n\nShe stops recording and turns to you. 'But should I tell them everything? About the ruins? The creatures? This planets potential? Or just the survival facts?'\n\n'Its my choice... but I want to hear what you think first.'"

      },
      {
        "question": "How long does the story take to complete?",
        "answer": "The full experience takes approximately 35-45 minutes across all 5 stages, with multiple endings that encourage replay with different choices."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I customize the story outcomes?",
        "answer": "Yes, player choices at key moments influence the narrative. You can choose what information Stella sends to Earth, whether to investigate mysterious signals, and how she resolves her feelings about home versus the new planet."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is this skill suitable for children?",
        "answer": "The skill contains themes of survival, separation from family, and existential questions. It is appropriate for mature children and adults who enjoy character-driven science fiction narratives."
      },
      {
        "question": "Does this skill modify any files on my system?",
        "answer": "No. This is a pure roleplay skill with no file access, network calls, or system modifications. It only generates narrative dialogue and story content."
      },
      {
        "question": "How does this connect to other NPC skills?",
        "answer": "The skill is part of a larger narrative universe. Successful signal repair can lead to escape-plan chapters, mysterious alien signals can lead to alien-encounter stories, and failed attempts can lead to daily-science settlement building."
