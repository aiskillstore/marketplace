        "question": "Should every list have an empty state?",

      {
        "question": "How do I prevent double submissions on forms?",
        "answer": "Set the disabled prop on submit buttons to the loading state. Also set isLoading to show visual feedback. This prevents clicks during submission and communicates the action is processing."
