Both are valid but point toward different resource allocations.\n\n**Synthesis:**\nPrioritize a progressive web app (PWA) that delivers mobile-friendly experiences while leveraging existing web infrastructure. This serves mobile users without the full native app maintenance cost.\n\n**Remaining Trade-offs:**\n- PWAs cannot fully replicate native app capabilities (offline, push notifications, app store presence)\n- Desktop users may see reduced investment as focus shifts to mobile experience"

Both approaches aim to reduce risk but from different angles.\n\n**Synthesis:**\nAdopt feature flags with a strict retirement policy (all flags must be removed within 2 sprints). Use flags only for genuine experiments and gradual rollouts, not as a substitute for feature completion.\n\n**Remaining Trade-offs:**\n- Some upfront investment needed in flag management tooling\n- Requires discipline from the entire team to maintain flag hygiene"

    "best_practices": [
      "Present both positions in their strongest form before synthesizing. Steel-man the opposition rather than attacking a weak version.",
      "Explicitly name the trade-offs in any synthesis. Clarity about what is being given up builds trust and prevents later surprises.",
      "Use dialectical analysis as a thinking aid before making decisions, not as a substitute for stakeholder input or expert judgment."
    ],
    "anti_patterns": [
      "Using synthesis as a way to avoid making hard decisions. Sometimes one position is genuinely stronger and should win.",
      "Skipping the antithesis phase. Presenting a weak opposing view and then easily refuting it produces poor synthesis.",
      "Treating the synthesis as a compromise average. Good synthesis should be greater than the sum of its parts."

    "faq": [
      {
        "question": "When should I use this skill versus making a unilateral decision?",
        "answer": "Use dialectical reasoning when multiple stakeholders have invested perspectives, when the trade-offs are genuinely uncertain, or when buy-in matters for execution. Make unilateral decisions when you have clear authority, when speed is critical, or when the decision falls clearly within your expertise."
      },
      {
        "question": "How many positions should I include in a dialectical analysis?",
        "answer": "Start with two (thesis/antithesis) for clarity. Add a third position when there is a genuinely distinct perspective that does not reduce to the other two. More than three positions can become unwieldy but may be useful for complex multi-stakeholder situations."
      },
      {
        "question": "What makes a good synthesis?",
        "answer": "A good synthesis preserves the strongest elements of competing positions while transcending their limitations. It should be more than a compromise (splitting the difference) and more than a preference for one side. Look for integration that neither position would have discovered alone."
      },
      {
        "question": "What if the positions are genuinely incompatible?",
        "answer": "Document the incompatibility clearly. Sometimes synthesis means explicitly choosing one path with full acknowledgment of what is lost. The skill helps clarify when positions are irreconcilable versus when integration is possible."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can this skill help with personal decision-making?",
        "answer": "Yes. Apply the same framework to personal choices: articulate what draws you to each option, surface the underlying values, and look for integration or explicit trade-offs. This works well for career decisions, investment choices, or lifestyle trade-offs."
      },
      {
        "question": "How does this differ from pros and cons lists?",
        "answer": "Dialectical reasoning goes deeper than pros and cons. It asks about underlying values, examines where positions conflict at the level of principles, and seeks synthesis that may reveal options neither list would suggest. Pros and cons are useful input to the process but not the process itself."
