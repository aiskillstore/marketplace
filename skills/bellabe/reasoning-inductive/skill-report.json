      {
        "question": "How do confidence bounds work in pattern validation?",

      {
        "question": "What should I do when patterns have many exceptions?",
        "answer": "Exception rates above 30% indicate the rule scope is too broad. Narrow the applicability by adding conditions or segment the data to find more specific patterns."
      },
      {
        "question": "When should I re-validate existing patterns?",
        "answer": "Set expiration dates based on data volatility. Re-validate when processes change, new exceptions appear, or when adding 3+ new observations that could strengthen or invalidate the pattern."
