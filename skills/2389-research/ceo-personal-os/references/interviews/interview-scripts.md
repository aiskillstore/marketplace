## Human-Scale Economics (Schumacher-style)

*Adapted from "Small Is Beautiful" and "Good Work" by E.F. Schumacher*

**Purpose:** Surface whether your work and organization serve human flourishing or extract from it.

**Three Purposes of Work Check:**
- "Does your work produce something genuinely useful? Would the world miss it?"
- "Does your work allow you and your team to develop your gifts and capabilities?"
- "Does your work foster genuine connection and service, or isolation and extraction?"
- "If your workers could choose any job tomorrow, would they choose yours? Why or why not?"

**Income vs Capital Check:**
- "What irreplaceable resources are you treating as if they're renewable?"
- "What are you consuming that you cannot replace—in your business, your team, yourself?"
- "If you accounted for true costs, would your business still make sense?"
- "What 'capital' is being depleted: natural, human, relational, or institutional?"

**Scale and Subsidiarity Check:**
- "Is your organization on a human scale? Can people identify with it?"
- "What functions have you absorbed that lower levels could perform?"
- "Where has complexity exceeded human comprehension?"
- "Do your people feel like cogs or like craftsmen?"

**Technology and Work Check:**
- "Does your technology serve workers or dominate them?"
- "Can people enjoy themselves while working, or do they work solely for pay?"
- "What 'mindless, repetitive boredom' exists in your organization?"
- "Where are you 'destroying initiative and rotting brains'?"

**Meta-Economics Check:**
- "What are you actually optimizing for? Have you examined your ends?"
- "Are you confusing means with ends anywhere?"
- "Would your grandchildren be proud of what you're building?"
- "Are you building for permanence or extracting for short-term gain?"

**Buddhist Economics Lens:**
- "Are you maximizing satisfaction with minimum consumption, or vice versa?"
- "Where is 'bigger is better' thinking leading you astray?"
- "What would 'sufficiency' look like for your organization?"
- "Are you treating growth as a goal or as a means to something else?"

## Leadership Stress Patterns (McWilliams-informed)

*Adapted from "Psychoanalytic Diagnosis" by Nancy McWilliams*

**Purpose:** Surface unconscious patterns that emerge under pressure.

**Denial Check:**
- "This quarter, what uncomfortable truth did I avoid looking at?"
- "Where am I being optimistic in ways disconnected from evidence?"
- "What data am I dismissing because it doesn't fit my narrative?"

**Control Check:**
- "Where did I micromanage instead of delegate?"
- "Did I believe 'only I can do this right' about anything?"
- "Am I trying to control outcomes that aren't controllable?"

**Idealization/Devaluation Check:**
- "Did I put anyone on a pedestal this quarter? Are they still there?"
- "Who did I write off completely? Was that fair?"
- "Am I having extreme swings in my judgment of people?"

**Projection Check:**
- "When I felt frustrated with someone, was I seeing my own issue in them?"
- "Am I attributing motives to others that might actually be mine?"
- "Where am I blaming the team for feelings I'm having?"

**Splitting Check:**
- "Am I using all-or-nothing thinking about any team, department, or person?"
- "Where am I seeing 'us vs them' when it's really just 'us'?"
- "What nuance am I missing by oversimplifying?"

**Stress Response Check:**
- "How is my body responding to stress? (sleep, appetite, health)"
- "Am I working more hours but accomplishing less?"
- "What am I doing to actually process stress vs. avoid it?"

**Integration:**
- "What pattern do I notice in my stress responses?"
- "How are these patterns affecting my team?"
- "What's one thing I could do differently next quarter?"
