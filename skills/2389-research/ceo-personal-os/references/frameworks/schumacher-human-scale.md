# E.F. Schumacher Human-Scale Economics

## Core Thesis

Modern economics commits a fatal error: treating irreplaceable capital as if it were renewable income. This applies to natural resources, to nature's tolerance margins, and to human substance itself.

> "A businessman would never consider a firm viable if it rapidly consumed its capital. Yet we do exactly this with Spaceship Earth."

## Three Purposes of Work

Work is central to human existence. Every CEO should ask whether their organization enables all three:

| Purpose | Description | Question |
|---------|-------------|----------|
| **Production** | Provide necessary and useful goods and services | Does our work produce something genuinely useful? |
| **Perfection** | Enable people to use and develop their gifts like good stewards | Does our work allow people to grow their capabilities? |
| **Liberation** | Serve and collaborate with others, liberating from egocentricity | Does our work foster connection and service? |

> "Without work, all life goes rotten, but when work is soulless, life stifles and dies." - Albert Camus

## Income vs Capital Framework

**The Fatal Error:** Treating irreplaceable resources as renewable income.

| Category | Description | Consequence of Depletion |
|----------|-------------|-------------------------|
| **Fossil Fuels / Non-renewables** | Found, not made | Threatens civilization |
| **Tolerance Margins of Nature** | Capacity to absorb and regenerate | Threatens life itself |
| **Human Substance** | Initiative, imagination, creativity, moral character | Threatens meaning and purpose |

**Application Questions:**
- Are we treating this resource as income (renewable) or capital (depleting)?
- What would change if we accounted for true costs?
- What are we consuming that we cannot replace?

## Human-Scale Technology Framework

Technology is not neutral. The choice of technology is a moral and political choice.

**Criteria for Appropriate Technology:**

| Criterion | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Scale** | Small enough for human comprehension and control |
| **Simplicity** | Simple enough for broad understanding and maintenance |
| **Capital-saving** | Affordable widely, not just for the wealthy |
| **Non-violent** | Gentle to nature and to human beings |
| **Creative** | Allows workers to use intelligence and skill |

**The Technology Question:** Can people enjoy themselves while working, or do they work solely for pay and hope for enjoyment in leisure?

## Scale and Organization (Subsidiarity)

**The Problem of Scale:**
- Large organizations tend toward complexity, impersonality, and alienation
- Small organizations often lack resources and specialization
- The challenge: achieve the virtues of both

**Principles for Large-Scale Organization:**

1. **Subsidiarity** - Higher levels should not absorb functions that lower levels can perform
2. **Identification** - People need to identify with an organization small enough to comprehend
3. **Quasi-firms** - Large organizations should contain small, quasi-autonomous units

**Key Tension:** Order vs Freedom. Neither pure centralization nor pure decentralization works.

## Buddhist Economics Lens

A middle way between materialist heedlessness and traditionalist immobility.

| Western Economics | Buddhist Economics |
|------------------|-------------------|
| Maximize consumption | Maximize satisfaction with minimum consumption |
| Labor is a cost to minimize | Right livelihood is a blessing to be enabled |
| Goods over people | People over goods |
| Bigger is better | Appropriate scale |
| Endless growth | Sufficiency and permanence |

## Meta-Economics Framework

**Three Levels of Economic Thought:**

| Level | Question | Domain |
|-------|----------|--------|
| **Meta-economics** | What are we trying to achieve? | Goals, values, ends |
| **Economics** | How do we achieve it efficiently? | Means, allocation |
| **Sub-economics** | Technical implementation | Methods, techniques |

**Critical Insight:** Modern economics jumps to means without examining ends. We optimize systems without asking what they're optimizing for.

## Key Principles

### On Growth
- "Unlimited growth in a finite environment is impossible"
- The logic of non-renewables: using them up faster doesn't make you richer

### On Production
- We have NOT solved "the problem of production" - this is the fateful error
- Modern man treats nature as something to conquer, not as something he is part of

### On Permanence
- Must design lifestyles, production methods, and consumption patterns for permanence
- Short-term efficiency often destroys long-term viability
- Peace requires assurance of permanence in economic life

### On Scale
- Gigantism: the disease of modern life
- Need for "technology with a human face"
- People need to identify with something small enough to comprehend

## Quarterly Review Questions

- **Purpose Check:** Does our work serve all three purposes (production, perfection, liberation)?
- **Capital Check:** What are we treating as income that is actually capital?
- **Scale Check:** Is our organization on a human scale? Can people identify with it?
- **Technology Check:** Does our technology serve workers or dominate them?
- **Subsidiarity Check:** Are we absorbing functions that lower levels could perform?
- **Meta-economics Check:** What are we actually optimizing for? Have we examined our ends?
- **Permanence Check:** Are we building for permanence or extracting for short-term gain?
