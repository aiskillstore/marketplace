        "question": "Will refactoring change how my components look?",

      },
      {
        "question": "How does the skill decide which patterns to extract?",
        "answer": "It identifies repeated utility class combinations appearing 2 or more times, checks if similar semantic classes already exist, and prioritizes high-frequency patterns for extraction to maximize code reduction."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I use this skill on individual components or does it require full project access?",
        "answer": "You can use it on individual components or specific files. The skill will analyze only the provided scope and suggest extractions based on patterns found within that scope."
      },
      {
        "question": "What testing does the skill add after refactoring?",
        "answer": "It adds static CSS tests to verify classes exist and contain expected properties, plus component rendering tests to ensure classes are applied correctly. You should still manually verify visual appearance."
      },
      {
        "question": "How does dark mode support work if my project does not have dark mode yet?",
        "answer": "The skill adds dark: variants following Tailwind conventions, preparing components for dark mode even if not currently enabled. These variants remain dormant until dark mode is activated in your project."
