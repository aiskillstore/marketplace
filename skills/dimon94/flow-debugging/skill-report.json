        "question": "What if I cannot reproduce the bug?",

      },
      {
        "question": "Can I skip the testing steps?",
        "answer": "No. Writing failing tests before fixes is mandatory in Phase 4. Tests provide confidence that your fix works and prevent regressions. Skipping tests means you don't know if the issue is truly resolved."
