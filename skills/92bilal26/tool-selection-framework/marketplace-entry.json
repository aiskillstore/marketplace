  "description": "Design systematic decision frameworks for selecting appropriate AI tools (Claude Code vs Gemini CLI)\nbased on context requirements, codebase size, reasoning depth needs, and task complexity. Use this\nskill when starting projects with unclear tool requirements, optimizing context-constrained workflows,\nor designing multi-phase strategies that leverage multiple tools' strengths. This skill helps match\ntool capabilities to task characteristics, preventing wasted context and ensuring optimal resource\nallocation.\n",
