Create a skill when you need to package domain expertise, reusable workflows, or tool integrations that transform Claude from a general-purpose agent into a specialized agent for specific tasks or domains."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is the minimum required structure for a skill?",
        "answer": "Every skill requires a SKILL.md file with YAML frontmatter containing 'name' and 'description' fields. The optional bundled resources include scripts/ for executable code, references/ for documentation, and assets/ for output files like templates."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I create a new skill from scratch?",
        "answer": "Run the initialization script: `scripts/init_skill.py <skill-name> --path <output-directory>`. This creates a properly structured skill directory with SKILL.md template and example resource directories that you can customize."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I package a skill for distribution?",
        "answer": "Run `scripts/package_skill.py <path/to/skill-folder>`. The script automatically validates the skill first (checking YAML frontmatter, directory structure, and file organization), then creates a zip file if validation passes."
      },
      {
        "question": "When should I use scripts versus references versus assets?",
        "answer": "Use scripts/ for executable code that needs deterministic reliability or is repeatedly rewritten. Use references/ for documentation that should be loaded into context as needed (like schemas, policies, API docs). Use assets/ for files used in output that shouldn't be loaded into context (like templates, images, icons)."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is progressive disclosure in skill design?",
        "answer": "Progressive disclosure is a design principle where skills have three loading levels: metadata (name + description, ~100 words) is always in context, SKILL.md body (<5k words) loads when the skill triggers, and bundled resources load as needed. This keeps SKILL.md lean while enabling unlimited depth through references and scripts."
