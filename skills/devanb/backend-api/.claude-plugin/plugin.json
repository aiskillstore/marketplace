Use this skill when creating or modifying API routes, controllers, or endpoints in files like routes/api.php, API controller files in app/Http/Controllers/Api/, controller files in app/Http/Controllers/, API resource classes, or when implementing REST API functionality. Use when working on URL structures, HTTP method handling (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE), API versioning strategies, query parameter handling for filtering/sorting/pagination, HTTP status code responses, rate limiting configuration, or any API endpoint design decisions.",
