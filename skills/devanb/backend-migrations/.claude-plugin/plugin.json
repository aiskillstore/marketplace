Use this skill when creating or editing migration files in database/migrations/, when writing schema changes (creating/modifying tables, columns, indexes, foreign keys), when implementing migration rollback methods, when managing database version control, when adding or modifying indexes on large tables, or when separating schema changes from data migrations for safer deployments.",
