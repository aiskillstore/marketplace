  "description": "Write minimal, evergreen code comments that explain complex logic without documenting obvious behavior or temporary changes. Use this skill when adding comments to PHP files, TypeScript/JavaScript files, or any code files, when documenting complex algorithms or business logic, when adding PHPDoc blocks or JSDoc comments, when writing self-documenting code with clear naming, or when reviewing existing comments for relevance and necessity. Focus on keeping code self-explanatory through clear structure and naming rather than relying heavily on comments.",
