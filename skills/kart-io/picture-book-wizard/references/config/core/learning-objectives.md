## Integration Guidelines

### How to Incorporate Learning Objectives

**In Story Text**:
- Naturally weave the objective into narrative
- Keep language age-appropriate
- Make objective observable in scene

**In Learning Point Section**:
Add a second learning element (optional):
```
✨ **学习要点 / Learning Point:**

逻辑 (Logic): 因为浇水，所以种子发芽 (Because watered, therefore seed sprouts)
```

Or:
```
✨ **学习要点 / Learning Point:**

```

**In Image Prompt**:
- Include visual elements that support the objective
- Show cause-effect relationships visually
- Depict object usage clearly

### Combining with Character Learning

**Primary + Secondary Learning**:
- Primary: Chinese character (always)
- Secondary: Logic/Object/Social/Emotional/Safety/Science (optional)
