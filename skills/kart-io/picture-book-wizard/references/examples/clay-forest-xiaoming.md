**Xiaoming + Forest + Clay = Perfect Adventure Setup**

1. **Character Match**: Xiaoming (6-year-old boy) is described as "adventurous and energetic" - forest exploration perfectly matches his personality traits.

2. **Age Appropriateness**: At 6 years old, Xiaoming can explore more independently than younger characters, making forest adventure credible and exciting.

3. **Style Harmony**: Clay style's warm, tactile quality makes the forest feel safe and inviting despite being an adventure setting - perfect for children's content.

4. **Gender Representation**: Provides male character option for stories, allowing boys to see themselves in picture books.
