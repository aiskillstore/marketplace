  "description": "Extract and analyze agent reasoning loops, step functions, and termination conditions. Use when needing to (1) understand how an agent framework implements reasoning (ReAct, Plan-and-Solve, Reflection, etc.), (2) locate the core decision-making logic, (3) analyze loop mechanics and termination conditions, (4) document the step-by-step execution flow of an agent, or (5) compare reasoning patterns across frameworks.",
