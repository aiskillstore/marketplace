# Skool One-Time Purchases - Critical Monetization Layer

**Date Added**: 2025-10-29
**Purpose**: Document Skool's classroom one-time purchase feature as a core monetization layer alongside tiers

---

## OVERVIEW

**CRITICAL INSIGHT**: Skool has TWO distinct monetization layers that work together:

1. **Group-Level Monetization**: Tiers (Free, Subscription, Freemium, Tiers, One-Time Payment)
2. **Classroom-Level Monetization**: One-Time Purchases (modules with "Buy now" access control)

**These are NOT mutually exclusive** - you can use BOTH simultaneously.

---

## CLASSROOM ONE-TIME PURCHASES

### What It Is

Inside your Skool community's **Classroom**, you can create modules (courses, resources, templates, services) that members pay for separately, independent of their tier/subscription status.

**Location**: Classroom → Add Course → Set Access Control

### Access Control Options

When creating a module in Classroom, you have 5 access control options:

#### **1. OPEN**
- **Who**: All members can access (no payment required)
- **Use Case**: Core community content, onboarding, free resources
- **Monetization**: None (builds value, engagement)

#### **2. LEVEL UNLOCK**
- **Who**: Members unlock at a specific level (gamification)
- **Use Case**: Progression-based content, retention incentive
- **Monetization**: Indirect (keeps members engaged to reach level)

#### **3. BUY NOW** ⭐ (PRIMARY MONETIZATION)
- **Who**: Members pay a one-time price to unlock
- **Price**: You set (e.g., $97, $497, $997)
- **Use Case**: Upsells, bonuses, premium courses, services, templates
- **Monetization**: Direct revenue per purchase

#### **4. TIME UNLOCK**
- **Who**: Members unlock after X days in community
- **Use Case**: Retention incentive, loyalty reward
- **Monetization**: Indirect (reduces churn, increases stickiness)

#### **5. PRIVATE**
- **Who**: Members on specific tier(s) OR specific members you designate
- **Use Case**: Tier differentiation, VIP bonuses, exclusivity
- **Monetization**: Indirect (makes higher tiers more valuable)
- **Important**: **Cannot combine with "Buy now"** - mutually exclusive

---

## KEY INSIGHT: TWO-LAYER MONETIZATION

### Layer 1: Group-Level (Tiers/Subscriptions)

**What**: How members JOIN your community
- Free (no payment)
- Subscription ($X/month or $Y/year)
- Freemium (free + paid upgrade tiers)
- Tiers (multiple paid tiers)
- One-Time Payment (single payment to join)

**Revenue**: Recurring (subscriptions) OR one-time (join fee)

### Layer 2: Classroom-Level (One-Time Purchases)

**What**: How members BUY products/services INSIDE your community (after joining)
- Courses ($97, $297, $997)
- Templates, tools, resources
- Done-for-you services
- Coaching packages
- Bonuses, masterclasses, workshops

**Revenue**: One-time payments (per purchase)

### The Magic: STACKABLE REVENUE

**Example Scenario**:
- Member joins: Freemium (free tier) → $0
- Month 1: Buys "AI Implementation Course" (Buy now) → $497
- Month 2: Upgrades to Premium tier → $97/month ongoing
- Month 3: Buys "Custom GPT Build Service" (Buy now) → $500
- **Total 3-month revenue**: $497 + $97 + $500 + $97 + $97 = $1,288 from ONE customer

**Without classroom purchases**: $97 × 3 = $291
**With classroom purchases**: $1,288 (4.4x more revenue)

## HORMOZI MECHANISM INTEGRATION

### Which Hormozi Mechanisms Use One-Time Purchases?

**ATTRACTION OFFERS**:
1. **Win Your Money Back** - One-time purchase with credit toward subscription if complete actions
2. **Giveaways** - Grand prize = one-time offer, losers get discounted one-time purchase
3. **Pay Less Now vs Pay More Later** - One-time offer at discount if buy within timeframe

**UPSELLS**:
6. **Classic Upsell** - Sequential one-time purchases (Course 1 → Course 2 → Course 3)
7. **Menu Upsell** - Multiple one-time purchases at different price points
9. **Rollover Upsell** - Credit from one-time purchase toward next one-time purchase

**DOWNSELLS**:
10. **Payment Plans** - Break one offer into multiple one-time purchases (Month 1, Month 2, Month 3)

**CONTINUITY**:
13. **Bonus Continuity Offer** - Give away one-time purchase (that normally costs $X) when joining subscription

## USE CASES FOR ONE-TIME PURCHASES

### Use Case 1: Front-Loaded Cash Collection

**Problem**: Member pays $97/month → Only $97 in first 30 days (doesn't cover CAC)

**Solution**: Add one-time purchases in first 30 days
- Day 7: Upsell "Implementation Sprint" ($997 one-time)
- Day 14: Upsell "Custom Service" ($500 one-time)
- **Result**: $97 + $997 + $500 = $1,594 in 30 days (covers CAC + funds 3+ customers)

### Use Case 2: Freemium Monetization

**Problem**: 500 free members, only 50 upgrade to paid tier (10% conversion)

**Solution**: Sell one-time purchases to free members
- Free tier: Community access only
- One-time: "AI Templates Pack" ($97)
- One-time: "AI Masterclass Recording" ($197)
- **Result**: 50 paid tier ($97/mo) + 100 one-time purchases ($97 avg) = $4,850 + $9,700 = $14,550/mo

**Without one-time purchases**: 50 × $97 = $4,850/mo
**With one-time purchases**: $14,550/mo (3x more revenue from SAME community)

### Use Case 3: Value Ladder

**Problem**: Only have one $97/month tier → Can't serve whales OR budget buyers

**Solution**: Create value ladder with one-time purchases
- Free tier: Basic community access
- One-time: "Foundations Course" ($297)
- One-time: "Advanced Implementation" ($997)
- One-time: "Done-for-You Service" ($2,500)
- Premium tier: $297/month (ongoing support)

**Result**: Members can buy what they need, when they need it

### Use Case 4: Bonus Stacking

**Problem**: Annual subscription ($1,164) hard to sell

**Solution**: Stack one-time purchases as bonuses
- Annual subscription: $1,164/year
- **Bonus**: Unlock 3 one-time purchases ($1,500 value)
  - "AI Automation Course" ($497)
  - "Custom GPT Templates" ($297)
  - "Monthly Strategy Call" ($700 value)
- **Perceived value**: $1,164 + $1,500 = $2,664

**Result**: Annual becomes easier sell (bonuses reduce perceived cost)

### Use Case 5: Payment Plans (Downsell)

**Problem**: Customer can't afford $997 upfront

**Solution**: Break into 3 one-time purchases
- Month 1 Access: $349 (Buy now)
- Month 2 Access: $349 (Buy now)
- Month 3 Access: $349 (Buy now)
- **Total**: $1,047 (slightly higher than $997, compensates for payment plan risk)

**Result**: Keep customers who would otherwise say no

## STRATEGIC CONSIDERATIONS

### When to Use One-Time Purchases vs Tiers

**Use One-Time Purchases When**:
- Product/service is discrete (course, template, service)
- Not everyone needs it (optional upsell)
- Value is delivered once (not ongoing access)
- Want to front-load cash (hit 30-day cash goal)

**Use Tiers When**:
- Ongoing access/support needed
- Differentiate service levels (Basic, Premium, VIP)
- Recurring revenue priority
- Community features vary by tier

**Use BOTH When**:
- Want maximum monetization flexibility
- Serve different customer segments
- Need front-loaded cash AND recurring revenue
- Have multiple products/services to sell

### Combining Tiers + One-Time Purchases

**Example Money Model**:

**Group Level (Tiers)**:
- Free: Basic community access
- Premium: $97/mo - Weekly group calls, premium courses
- VIP: $297/mo - Everything + monthly 1-on-1 call

**Classroom Level (One-Time)**:
- "AI Foundations Course": $297 (OR free for Premium+)
- "Custom GPT Build Service": $500 (OR $300 for VIP)
- "Template Library": $97 (OR free for Premium+)

**Flexibility**:
- Free members can buy one-time items without upgrading tier
- Premium members get some items free (incentive to upgrade)
- VIP members get discounts on one-time items
- Everyone can access everything (tier OR purchase)

---

## COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID

### Mistake 1: Only Using Tiers

**Problem**: Leaving money on table - free members won't all upgrade, but WILL buy products

**Solution**: Add one-time purchases for upsells, even if you have tiers

### Mistake 2: Overcomplicating Access Control

**Problem**: Mixing "Buy now" with "Private" (not possible - mutually exclusive)

**Solution**: Choose ONE per module:
- "Buy now" = Anyone can purchase
- "Private" = Only specific tiers/members (no payment)

### Mistake 3: Not Using One-Time for Bonuses

**Problem**: Annual subscription hard to sell without perceived value stacking

**Solution**: Create one-time purchases (even if not selling them standalone), then offer as bonuses:
- "Join annual, unlock these 3 courses ($1,500 value) free"
- Courses exist in Classroom with "Buy now $497" (but you manually grant access to annual members)

### Mistake 4: Ignoring Freemium + One-Time Combo

**Problem**: Freemium model → Only monetizing 10-20% who upgrade to paid tier

**Solution**: Sell one-time purchases to the 80-90% who stay free
- Free tier: Access community only
- One-time: Sell courses, templates, services ($97-$997)
- **Result**: Monetize free members WITHOUT requiring tier upgrade

## INTEGRATION WITH EXISTING KNOWLEDGE BASE

### Updates Needed to Core Skill

**SKILL.md Updates**:
1. **Add to "5 Skool Business Models" section**: Clarify that One-Time Payment (group-level) is DIFFERENT from one-time purchases (classroom-level)
2. **Add new section**: "Two-Layer Monetization" (Group-level + Classroom-level)
3. **Add to workflow**: Ask "Do you have courses/products to sell as one-time purchases?" (not just "to tier-lock")

**Framework Updates**:
1. **30-Day Cash Maximization**: Include one-time purchase take rates in gap analysis
2. **Sequential Implementation**: Prioritize one-time purchases for Stage 2-3 (front-loaded cash)
3. **Skool Model Selection**: Explain Freemium + One-Time = highest monetization flexibility

**Mechanism Updates** (Already Good):
- Hormozi-Skool-Money-Models-Reference.md already covers this extensively
- Just need to highlight it more prominently in main skill workflow

## EXAMPLE SCENARIOS

### Scenario 1: Stage 2 (Revenue < CAC)

**Current State**:
- CAC: $400
- 30-day revenue: $97 (monthly subscription only)
- Gap: $303

**Recommendation WITH One-Time Purchases**:
"Add ONE one-time purchase as upsell in first 30 days:
- Option A: 'Implementation Course' ($497) - Need 61% take rate → Exceeds target
- Option B: 'Custom Service' ($997) - Need 30% take rate → Exceeds target
- Option C: Annual subscription ($1,164) - Need 26% take rate → Exceeds target

**Setup**: Create module in Classroom → Set access to 'Buy now $497' → Promote on Day 7 via DM/email"

### Scenario 2: Freemium Monetization

**Current State**:
- Model: Freemium (free + $97/mo Premium tier)
- 500 free members, 50 Premium (10% conversion)
- Goal: Monetize free members without forcing tier upgrade

**Recommendation WITH One-Time Purchases**:
"Create 2-3 one-time purchases for free members:
- 'AI Templates Pack' ($97 - Buy now)
- 'Masterclass Recording' ($197 - Buy now)
- 'Custom Strategy Session' ($500 - Buy now)

**Expected**: 20% of free members buy at least one = 100 purchases × $150 avg = $15,000 additional revenue/month

**Setup**: Classroom → Add Course for each product → Set 'Buy now' → Promote in community posts"

## SUMMARY

**Key Takeaways**:

1. **Two Layers**: Group-level (tiers) + Classroom-level (one-time purchases) work together
2. **Stackable Revenue**: Can earn from BOTH subscriptions AND one-time sales
3. **Access Control**: 5 options (Open, Level unlock, Buy now, Time unlock, Private)
4. **"Buy now" is KEY**: This is the primary monetization option for classroom modules
5. **Not mutually exclusive with tiers**: Use BOTH for maximum revenue
6. **Front-loads cash**: One-time purchases help hit 30-day cash targets (2x CAC)
7. **Monetizes free members**: Freemium + one-time = 3x more revenue potential
8. **Hormozi-compatible**: 10+ mechanisms explicitly use one-time purchases

**This is a CRITICAL feature that should be prominently featured in the skill's workflow and recommendations.**

**End of Addendum**

This document should be integrated into the main skill workflow to ensure users understand and leverage this powerful monetization layer.
