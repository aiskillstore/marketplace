## CATEGORY 1: ATTRACTION OFFERS

### 1. WIN YOUR MONEY BACK

**What It Is**: Customers get their initial purchase refunded if they complete specific requirements (actions or outcomes)

**Psychology**: Reduces perceived risk, increases engagement, drives retention

**Skool Implementation**:

**Structure:**
- Free community (entry point)
- One-time purchase upsell (via DM or call)
- Two subscription tiers (Tier 1 = won money back, Tier 2 = didn't win)

**Step-by-Step Setup:**

1. **Create free community** in Skool
2. **Add one-time purchase** in classroom (e.g., $500-$2000)
   - Include: courses, materials, calls, services, downloads
3. **Define winning requirements** (choose one or combine):
   - **Outcome-based**: Achieve specific result
   - **Action-based**:
     - 30-day fire emoji streak
     - Post X times
     - Reach certain level
     - Leave reviews
4. **Create two subscription tiers**:
   - **Tier 1 (Winners)**: Lower price (original purchase credited)
   - **Tier 2 (Non-winners)**: Full price
5. **Credit calculation**:
   - Example: $1000 one-time purchase → Credit $1000 toward subscription
   - Could be 6 months credit, 12 months, etc.

**Key Points:**
- Both tiers may offer same service, just different pricing
- Winners feel rewarded for engagement
- Non-winners still get value from one-time purchase
- Drives ACTION in community (key to retention)

**Example Flow:**
1. Member joins free community
2. You DM upsell: "$1000 one-time program access"
3. They buy
4. They complete 30-day streak + 20 posts
5. You qualify them for Tier 1 subscription ($100/mo instead of $250/mo)
6. Their $1000 is credited ($100 off x 10 months = $1000 credit)

---

### 2. GIVEAWAYS

**What It Is**: Run contest with grand prize, then offer losers discounted purchase

**Psychology**: Creates excitement, FOMO, and secondary monetization opportunity

**Skool Implementation**:

**Two Options:**

#### **OPTION A: One-Time Purchase Giveaway**

**Setup:**
1. **Create flagship one-time offer** (e.g., $1000 program)
2. **Run promotion** inside community
3. **Grand drawing** → announce winner
4. **Winner gets free access**
5. **Reach out to everyone else** → offer discounted version
6. **Process through Skool** as secondary one-time purchase

**Example:**
- Grand prize: $1000 coaching program (free)
- Everyone else: Same program for $497 (50% off, limited time)

#### **OPTION B: Subscription Giveaway**

**Setup:**
1. **Create subscription tier** (e.g., $500/mo premium)
2. **Grand prize**: 12 months free subscription
3. **Everyone else**: Discounted subscription rate for limited time
   - Create separate tier with same features at discount
   - Example: $500/mo → $297/mo for 3 months, then $500/mo

**Hormozi's Skool-Specific Tip:**
> "Double up on grand prize: 'If your friend wins, you win too' → Massively increases community participation"

**Implementation Steps:**
1. Announce giveaway with clear rules
2. Set entry requirements (posts, referrals, engagement)
3. Run drawing (use Skool post for transparency)
4. Award grand prize
5. **Within 24-48 hours**: Message all non-winners with discount offer
6. Process purchases through Skool classroom

---

### 3. DECOY OFFER

**What It Is**: Offer two options where the expensive one makes the cheaper one look like a steal (but cheaper one is what you want most to buy)

**Psychology**: Anchoring effect - expensive option shifts perceived value

**Skool Implementation**:

**Structure:** Monthly vs Annual subscriptions (with strategic pricing)

**Setup:**
1. **Monthly subscription**: $100/mo (your real target)
2. **Annual subscription**: $1500/yr (decoy - not 12x monthly)
   - **Key**: Annual includes EXTRAS that monthly doesn't
   - Courses, bonuses, one-time items bundled in

**Strategic Pricing:**
- Annual is NOT just 12x monthly (that's boring)
- Annual = Monthly + Premium Bonuses
- Example:
  - Monthly: $100/mo = $1200/yr (community access only)
  - Annual: $1500/yr (community + $2000 course + 3 group calls + templates)

**The Magic:**
- Some people buy annual (whales) → Great!
- Most people see annual, think "I don't need all that"
- Monthly now looks like amazing value by comparison
- Monthly becomes easier sell

**Implementation Steps:**
1. Create monthly tier with core features
2. Create annual tier at NON-12x price
3. Bundle high-perceived-value items into annual (courses, calls, downloads)
4. Position monthly as "just the community" (still valuable)
5. Let customers self-select

**Example:**
- **Monthly**: $200/mo - Community access, weekly Q&A calls
- **Annual**: $2997/yr - Everything in monthly + AI automation course ($1997 value) + monthly 1:1 call ($500/mo value) + template library

Customers think: "I don't need the 1:1 calls, I'll just do monthly" → Sale made easier

---

### 4. BUY X GET Y FREE

**What It Is**: Quantity multiplier - buy more time, get free time added

**Psychology**: Discounts time cost, front-loads cash flow

**Skool Implementation**:

**Structure:** Monthly vs Annual (different approach than Decoy)

**Setup:**
1. **Monthly**: $100/mo (standard rate)
2. **Annual**: $600/yr (buy 6 months, get 6 free)
   - Could also do: Buy 9, get 3 free ($900/yr)
   - Or: Buy 8, get 4 free ($800/yr)

**Key Difference from Decoy:**
- Decoy = Add premium bonuses to annual
- Buy X Get Y = Discount time itself (same features both tiers)

**Benefits:**
- Front-loads cash flow (better for ads, sales commissions)
- Simple to understand
- Strong value proposition

**Implementation Steps:**
1. Determine monthly rate (e.g., $100/mo)
2. Calculate annual discount structure
3. Frame as "free months" not "percent off"
4. Create two subscription tiers in Skool
5. Clearly label: "Buy 6 Get 6" or "50% off annual"

**Variations:**
- Buy 6 get 6 free (50% off)
- Buy 9 get 3 free (25% off)
- Buy 8 get 4 free (33% off)

**Example:**
"Join CCGG Monthly: $297/mo or Annual: $1788 (buy 6 months, get 6 free - save $1788)"

---

### 5. PAY LESS NOW VS PAY MORE LATER

**What It Is**: Urgency-based offer - buy now at discount or pay full price later

**Psychology**: Loss aversion, scarcity, urgency

**Skool Implementation**:

**Structure:** Time-limited one-time purchase upsells

**Setup:**
1. Member joins community (free or paid)
2. Immediately offer time-limited upsell
3. If they buy now → Discounted rate
4. If they wait → Full price (or access removed entirely)

**Example:**
"I have this $2000 program. If you buy within 48 hours of joining, you get it for $1000. After 48 hours, it goes to full price $2000 (or disappears entirely)."

**Implementation Steps:**
1. **Create one-time offer** in Skool classroom (e.g., $2000 program)
2. **Identify trigger point**: When member joins, posts intro, reaches level, etc.
3. **Send DM with deadline**: "You have 48 hours to access this at $1000"
4. **Create discounted version** (temporary one-time purchase at $1000)
5. **After deadline**: Remove discount access, only show $2000 version (or hide entirely)

**Automation Options:**
- Manual DM when new member joins
- Automated welcome sequence (if using email integration)
- Post in "new members" section with deadline

**The Pitch:**
"If you buy today, you pay less. If you don't buy today, you'll have to pay more later (or it won't be available)."

**Key Point from Hormozi:**
> "This is an urgency tactic - the key is they lose access to the discount or the offer entirely if they don't act now."

## CATEGORY 2: UPSELLS

### 6. CLASSIC UPSELL

**What It Is**: After someone buys, offer the next logical thing that solves the next problem

**Psychology**: Problem-solution chain, natural progression

**Skool Implementation**:

**Two Methods:**

#### **METHOD A: One-Time Purchase Chain**

**Structure:**
- Classroom with multiple one-time purchases
- Each purchase unlocks next problem/solution

**Setup:**
1. **Purchase 1**: Solves Problem A (e.g., "AI Foundations" - $500)
2. **Purchase 2**: Solves Problem B that Problem A creates (e.g., "AI Implementation" - $1000)
3. **Purchase 3**: Solves Problem C that Problem B creates (e.g., "AI Scaling" - $2000)

**Implementation:**
- Create 3-5 one-time purchases in classroom
- **Critical**: In each purchase, tell them what to buy next
- Example: Inside "AI Foundations" course, final lesson says "Now that you understand AI, you need to implement it → Buy 'AI Implementation' next"

#### **METHOD B: Subscription Tier Chain**

**Structure:**
- Multiple subscription tiers
- Lower tier solves Problem A, creates Problem B
- Higher tier solves Problem B

**Setup:**
1. **$100/mo tier**: Basic community, solves getting started
2. **$500/mo tier**: Advanced implementation, solves scaling (only relevant after solving getting started)

**The Key Concept:**
"We want to solve one problem that then OPENS UP another problem, which we solve through the upsell."

**Implementation Steps:**
1. Map customer journey (what problems do they solve in sequence?)
2. Create offers for each stage
3. **Make the next step OBVIOUS** at each stage
4. Repeat upsell messaging multiple times throughout customer journey
5. Use community posts, DMs, calls to reinforce upsell path

**Example for CCGG:**
- Problem A: "I don't know how to use AI" → AI Foundations Course ($500)
- Problem B (created by solving A): "I know AI but don't know what to build" → AI Business Models Course ($1000)
- Problem C (created by solving B): "I built something but need help selling it" → AI Sales & Marketing Program ($2000)

**Hormozi's Warning:**
> "Seems logical, but you'd be amazed - people don't tell customers what to buy next. Make it clear, obvious, and easy."

---

### 7. MENU UPSELL

**What It Is**: Show multiple options, unsell (tell them what NOT to buy), then recommend the right one

**Psychology**: Trust-building through honesty, creates context for value

**Skool Implementation**:

**Two Applications:**

#### **APPLICATION A: One-Time Purchase Menu**

**Setup:**
1. **Create 4-6 one-time purchases** in classroom at different price points
2. Some are high-ticket ($5000+) that you don't intend to sell to many
3. When talking to prospect, show them multiple options
4. **Unsell**: Tell them what they DON'T need
5. **Recommend**: The one that actually fits

**Example:**
"I have 5 programs:
- $10,000 - Full Done-for-You (you don't need this, you're technical)
- $5,000 - Done-with-You (too much hand-holding for you)
- $2,000 - Self-Guided Implementation (perfect for your situation)
- $1,000 - Foundations (you're past this stage)
- $500 - Templates Only (won't solve your problem)"

**Result:** You build trust by NOT selling everything, they buy the $2000 offer

#### **APPLICATION B: Subscription Menu**

**Setup:**
1. Create multiple subscription tiers ($5000/mo, $2000/mo, $2000/mo at different focuses)
2. When enrolling member, show all options
3. **Unsell**: "You don't qualify for the $5000/mo tier yet, you need X first"
4. **Recommend**: "Based on your situation, $2000/mo tier is perfect"

**The Key:**
"Tell them what they DON'T qualify for that you already thought through. When you do that, you increase likelihood they take your recommended offer."

**Implementation Steps:**
1. Create menu of 4-6 offers (one-time or subscription)
2. Include at least 1-2 you DON'T want most people to buy (high price, specific use case)
3. When prospect asks about joining:
   - Show full menu
   - Explain each option
   - Unsell 2-3 options ("Not right for you because...")
   - Recommend 1 option ("This is perfect because...")
4. Process purchase through Skool

**Why This Works:**
- Builds trust (you're not just selling everything)
- Creates context (they see what they're NOT paying for)
- Makes recommendation feel personalized
- Higher conversion on recommended offer

---

### 8. ANCHOR UPSELL

**What It Is**: Use expensive offer to make core offer look like incredible value (10% difference in features, 10x difference in price)

**Psychology**: Price anchoring, relative value perception

**Skool Implementation**:

**Three Places to Apply:**

#### **PLACE 1: One-Time Purchases**
- Anchor: $5000 program with Feature X
- Core: $500 program without Feature X (you want everyone to buy this)
- Feature X is minor, price difference is massive

#### **PLACE 2: Subscription Tiers**
- Anchor: $1000/mo with weekly 1:1 calls
- Core: $100/mo with monthly group calls
- 1:1 vs group is the only difference

#### **PLACE 3: Annual vs Monthly**
- Anchor: $5000/yr with done-for-you setup
- Core: $100/mo without setup
- Setup is one-time thing, price difference is huge

**The Magic Formula:**
> "The core offer should be 10% different than the anchor, but 1/10th the price."

**What This Means:**
- Anchor has ONE extra feature (minor)
- Anchor costs 10X more
- Customer thinks: "I don't really need that feature, and this is a smoking deal"

**Implementation Steps:**
1. **Design core offer** (what you want most people to buy)
2. **Add small premium feature** (creates anchor)
3. **Price anchor at 10x core price**
4. **Create both in Skool**
5. **Present anchor first** when showing options
6. **Let customer choose**

**Example:**
- **Anchor**: $2000/mo - Everything + weekly 1:1 strategy call
- **Core**: $200/mo - Everything (community, courses, group calls)
- Most people think: "I can ask questions in group calls, I don't need weekly 1:1 for 10x the price"
- Core offer now feels like incredible value
- Some whales will want the 1:1 → Bonus revenue

**Hormozi's Insight:**
> "Some people will always buy the most expensive thing. Congratulations, you got a whale. For everybody else, they'll be very happy and more likely to buy your core offer."

**Application to CCGG:**
- Anchor: $997/mo - Full CCGG + monthly 1:1 with Daron
- Core: $97/mo - Full CCGG (community, courses, all content)
- 1:1 with Daron is valuable but not essential
- Makes $97/mo look like a steal

---

### 9. ROLLOVER UPSELL

**What It Is**: After someone buys, give them credit from their purchase toward the next purchase (for limited time)

**Psychology**: Sunk cost bias, "free" perception, urgency

**Skool Implementation**:

**Three Applications:**

#### **APPLICATION A: One-Time → One-Time Rollover**

**Setup:**
1. Customer buys Purchase 1 ($500)
2. Immediately offer Purchase 2 ($1500) with $500 credit
3. Effectively: Purchase 1 "free" if they buy Purchase 2 for $1000

**Implementation:**
1. Customer buys $500 course
2. Send DM: "Congrats! For next 48 hours, I'll credit your $500 toward the $1500 program. You pay $1000, get both."
3. Create temporary $1000 one-time purchase (limited time)
4. After 48 hours, remove discount

**Key:** Only offer for limited time (via DM, call, or webinar)

#### **APPLICATION B: One-Time → Subscription Rollover**

**Setup:**
1. Customer buys one-time purchase ($600)
2. Offer subscription ($100/mo) with credit applied
3. $50/mo discount for 12 months (= $600 credit)

**Example:**
"You just bought the $600 course. Join monthly membership for $100/mo, and I'll apply your $600 as $50/mo discount for 12 months. You pay $50/mo for a year, then $100/mo after."

**Implementation:**
1. Customer buys $600 course
2. Create temporary subscription tier: $50/mo (12-month credit applied)
3. After 12 months, price adjusts to $100/mo
4. Manage manually or via Skool subscription settings

#### **APPLICATION C: Low Subscription → High Subscription Rollover**

**Setup:**
1. Customer on $100/mo tier
2. Upsell to $500/mo tier
3. Credit their $100/mo → They pay $400/mo

**Example:**
"You're currently paying $100/mo. Upgrade to $500/mo tier, and I'll credit your current subscription. You only pay $400/mo."

**Implementation:**
1. Customer on $100/mo
2. Send upgrade offer
3. Create $400/mo tier (temporary, just for this customer)
4. They switch from $100/mo to $400/mo
5. Frame as "You're already paying $100, so only $400 more"

**The Trigger for Sunk Cost:**
> "It triggers sunk cost bias in buyers - they want to get credit for what they just bought. Makes the first thing feel free if they buy the next thing."

**Hormozi's Warning:**
> "You're going to lose the $500 on that sale, so don't use it all the time unless that's your primary strategy for moving people from thing 1 to thing 2."

**When to Use:**
- For high-value customers you want to move up ladder quickly
- During launch periods to drive urgency
- To rescue at-risk cancellations (move them up instead of losing them)

---

## CATEGORY 3: DOWNSELLS

### 10. PAYMENT PLANS

**What It Is**: Break large purchase into smaller monthly payments

**Psychology**: Reduces sticker shock, increases affordability perception

**Skool Implementation**:

**Important Note from Hormozi:**
> "Payment plans on Skool happen differently than you might expect. Because of processing issues and people being weird, we facilitate payment plans almost like a cohort."

**Structure:** Create sequential one-time purchases (Month 1, Month 2, Month 3)

**Setup Example:**

**Offer:** 3-month program for $1000/month ($3000 total)

**In Skool Classroom, create 3 separate one-time purchases:**
1. Month 1 Access - $1000
2. Month 2 Access - $1000
3. Month 3 Access - $1000

**How It Works:**
1. Customer buys "Month 1 Access" ($1000)
2. Gets access to Month 1 content/calls
3. To access Month 2, must purchase "Month 2 Access" ($1000)
4. To access Month 3, must purchase "Month 3 Access" ($1000)

**Implementation Steps:**
1. Design your program with clear monthly phases
2. Create separate one-time purchase for each month
3. Tie content/access to time period
4. Customer buys month-by-month
5. If they stop paying, they stop progressing

**Why This Works:**
"The thing is, in my experience, if someone doesn't want to buy, they're going to cancel anyways. Adding this tiny little step will decrease friction on the front end for the sale, and as long as you're doing a good job, people will make that second and third purchase."

**Alternative Use: Cohorts**

**Same concept for cohort-based programs:**
- Cohort 1 → One-time purchase ($1000)
- Cohort 2 → One-time purchase ($1000)
- Cohort 3 → One-time purchase ($1000)

**Benefits:**
- Lower barrier to entry (vs $3000 upfront)
- Self-qualifying customers (if they don't buy Month 2, they weren't committed)
- Easier to sell ("Just commit to Month 1, $1000")

**Drawback:**
- Slightly higher friction (customer must repurchase each month)
- Only committed customers continue

**Example for CCGG:**
- AI Business Builder 12-Week Program
- Week 1-4 Access - $500
- Week 5-8 Access - $500
- Week 9-12 Access - $500
- Total: $1500 if they complete all 3 phases

---

### 11. TRIALS WITH PENALTY

**What It Is**: Free trial where completing actions earns permanent discount

**Psychology**: Activation incentive, reward for engagement

**Skool Implementation**:

**Structure:** Free trial → Action requirements → Discounted subscription for completers

**Setup:**

1. **Offer free trial** (7-14 days)
2. **Set action requirements**:
   - Post X times
   - Complete onboarding checklist
   - Attend X calls
   - Reach certain level
3. **Two subscription tiers:**
   - Tier 1 (Completers): $49/mo (discounted)
   - Tier 2 (Non-completers): $100/mo (full price)

**How It Works:**
1. Member signs up for free trial into $100/mo subscription
2. During trial, you set clear actions: "Complete these 5 tasks in 7 days"
3. If they complete → Send link to $49/mo tier (limited time offer)
4. They immediately purchase $49/mo subscription
5. If they don't complete → Trial converts to $100/mo

**Implementation Steps:**
1. Create free trial option in Skool
2. Set trial period (7-14 days)
3. Create activation checklist in community:
   - Introduce yourself (post)
   - Complete welcome course
   - Attend 1 group call
   - Post 3 times in community
4. Create two subscription tiers:
   - $100/mo (default)
   - $49/mo (hidden, only shared with completers)
5. Monitor trial members
6. For completers: Send DM with $49/mo link (48-hour window)
7. For non-completers: Auto-convert to $100/mo

**The Key Insight:**
> "This incentivizes them to follow through and self-activate because they'll get a discount associated with it. You tie their activation metrics with a strong incentive and ultimately get people who are far more engaged and stay longer."

**Benefits:**
- Drives trial activation (critical for retention)
- Rewards engaged members
- Self-selects committed customers
- Higher LTV from activated members (even at lower price)

**Example:**
"Join CCGG free for 7 days. Complete our Success Sprint (5 tasks), and lock in $47/mo forever. Don't complete? No problem, continue at $97/mo."

---

### 12. FEATURE DOWNSELLS

**What It Is**: Offer cheaper versions by removing features (strategic value-to-price ratios)

**Psychology**: Gives options, captures customers at different price points

**Skool Implementation**:

**Structure:** Multiple tiers (one-time or subscription) with decreasing features and prices

**The Magic (Hormozi's Key Insight):**
> "The magic is not just having tiers - it's HOW MUCH you change the price versus WHAT you take away. The relationship between those is where the magic happens."

**Strategic Pricing:**

#### **First Downsell (from top tier):**
- Take away something VERY valuable
- Decrease price only SLIGHTLY
- **Goal:** Encourage people to stay at top tier

**Example:**
- Top: $500/mo - Everything + weekly 1:1 coaching
- First Downsell: $400/mo - Everything (no 1:1)
- Removed: Weekly 1:1 ($500+ value)
- Price decrease: Only $100
- **Result:** Most people think "For $100 more, I get $500 value? I'll take top tier."

#### **Second & Third Downsells:**
- Take away SMALL amount of value
- Decrease price DISPROPORTIONATELY
- **Goal:** Get them to buy SOMETHING

**Example:**
- First Downsell: $400/mo - Community + all courses + group calls
- Second Downsell: $200/mo - Community + core courses (no bonuses)
- Removed: Bonus courses ($100 value)
- Price decrease: $200
- **Result:** "Wow, $200 less for almost everything? I'll take it."

**Full Example Structure:**

**One-Time Purchases:**
1. **Tier 1**: $2000 - Full program + 3 months 1:1 support + templates + group
2. **Tier 2**: $1800 - Full program + templates + group (no 1:1)
   - Removed major value, small price drop → Pushes to Tier 1
3. **Tier 3**: $1200 - Full program + group (no 1:1, no templates)
   - Removed moderate value, moderate price drop
4. **Tier 4**: $500 - Core program only (no support, templates, or group)
   - Removed massive value, massive price drop → Gets people who can't afford more

**Subscription Tiers:**
1. **Tier 1**: $300/mo - Everything + monthly 1:1
2. **Tier 2**: $250/mo - Everything (no 1:1)
   - $50 less, removed $500 value → Pushes to Tier 1
3. **Tier 3**: $100/mo - Community + courses (no calls, no 1:1)
   - $150 less, removed moderate value
4. **Tier 4**: $47/mo - Community only
   - Gets people in the door

**Implementation Steps:**
1. Design top tier with all features
2. Create first downsell: Remove high-value item, small price drop
3. Create middle downsells: Moderate value removal, moderate price drops
4. Create bottom tier: Minimal features, low price (door-opener)
5. Set up all tiers in Skool
6. Present top tier first, downsell sequentially if needed

**The Strategy:**
- **Top tier**: Best value per dollar (encourage this)
- **Middle tiers**: Decent options if budget constrained
- **Bottom tier**: Get them in the ecosystem

**Hormozi's Framework:**
"Play with those 3-4 levels. Structure the value versus the price - that's where the magic happens."

## CATEGORY 4: CONTINUITY (SUBSCRIPTION MECHANISMS)

### 13. BONUS CONTINUITY OFFER

**What It Is**: Give away valuable one-time item (that you normally charge for) as bonus for joining subscription within timeframe

**Psychology**: Exclusive bonus, urgency, increases perceived value

**Skool Implementation**:

**Structure:** Subscription + One-time bonus (if join within window)

**Hormozi's Take:**
> "School makes this really, really chef's kiss."

**Setup:**

1. **Create subscription tier** (e.g., $100/mo)
2. **Create one-time purchase** (e.g., $1000 course) that you DO charge for normally
3. **Add to community About page:** "Join within X days/via this webinar/via this DM, get $1000 course free"
4. **When they subscribe:** Immediately unlock the $1000 one-time purchase for them

**The Key Difference from Basic Bonuses:**
> "Not just saying 'all this stuff comes with my group' - that's 101. The 201 version is: I really DO charge for this thing, this thing really IS valuable, and when you join, I will unlock this thing only for you for a period of time, so you know it's legit."

**Implementation Steps:**

1. **Create your one-time bonus item** (course, template pack, etc.)
2. **Price it in classroom** ($1000) so people can see it has real value
3. **Don't advertise it as "for sale"** - it's "bonus only"
4. **Add to subscription sales page/About page:**
   - "Join CCGG this week and unlock the AI Automation Playbook ($1997 value) completely free"
5. **When member joins:**
   - Manually grant access to the one-time item
   - OR send them private link to claim it free
6. **Emphasize scarcity:** "Only for members who join during launch week"

**Why It Works:**
- People see the $1000 price tag → It's valuable
- Getting it "free" by joining → Massive perceived value
- "Maybe I could just buy the $1000 thing?" → No, only available as bonus
- Creates urgency to join now

**Example:**
"Join CCGG Monthly ($97/mo) this week and immediately unlock:
- The AI Revenue Roadmap Course (normally $1997, yours free)
- Only available to new members joining before Friday"

**Bonus Variation:**
- Webinar attendees get bonus
- Members who join via specific DM campaign get bonus
- First 50 members get bonus

**The Underlying Principle:**
"Something magical about somebody having the option to potentially just buy one thing versus getting that thing that otherwise DOES have a price tag for free by joining."

### 14. CONTINUITY DISCOUNT OFFERS

**What It Is**: Give free months after customer completes paid months (pulls people through paid period)

**Psychology**: Loyalty reward, milestone incentive, encourages retention

**Skool Implementation**:

**Two Methods:**

#### **METHOD A: Free Trial (Standard)**
- Obvious application, Hormozi mentions but focuses on Method B

#### **METHOD B: Back-End Free Months (Hormozi's Focus)**

**Structure:** "Complete X months, get Y months free"

**Setup Example:**

**Monthly subscription:** $100/mo

**Offer:** "Complete 9 payments on time, get 3 months free"

**How It Works:**
1. Customer subscribes at $100/mo
2. They pay for 9 months ($900 total)
3. After 9th payment, you say: "You can turn off your billing now"
4. You manually keep them in community for 3 more months (free)
5. After 3 free months, they can re-subscribe if they want

**Implementation Steps:**
1. Create monthly subscription ($100/mo)
2. Track customer payment history (manual or via Skool)
3. Monitor for milestone (9 payments completed)
4. After 9th payment:
   - Send congratulations message
   - "You've unlocked 3 free months! Turn off billing now."
   - Manually maintain their access for 3 months
5. After 3 months:
   - Offer to re-subscribe
   - Many will continue paying

**Key Terms for This to Work:**
> "They have to pay ON TIME, they have to have NO CHURN ISSUES, and they have to pay IN FULL at retail price for that period."

**Benefits:**
- Encourages stick (retention)
- Encourages engagement (to earn the reward)
- Puts reward at END of relationship (not beginning)
- Creates loyalty

**The Strategic Insight:**
> "You can make a longer period they give away for free to incentivize to pull people through the paid period to get to the carrot."

**Advanced Version:**
> "If you want to be a smart cookie, you can always keep pulling out more and more time and adding it on the end if they just continue to double down."

**Example:**
- Complete 9 months → Get 3 months free
- Complete 12 more months → Get another 3 months free
- Complete 18 more months → Get 6 months free
- Creates compounding loyalty

**Variations:**
- Buy 6 get 6 free (complete 6 payments, get 6 months free)
- Buy 9 get 3 free
- Buy 12 get 3 free

**Example for CCGG:**
"Join CCGG Monthly at $97/mo. Complete 12 on-time payments, and we'll give you your next 3 months completely free ($291 value). Keep engaging, and we'll extend even more free time as a loyal member reward."

**Front-End vs Back-End Positioning:**
- Front-end (standard): "3 months free trial, then $100/mo"
- Back-end (Hormozi's method): "Complete 9 months, EARN 3 months free"

Back-end version drives retention and engagement better.

### 15. WAIVE FEE OFFER

**What It Is**: Waive expensive onboarding fee if customer commits to longer subscription term

**Psychology**: Risk-sharing, commitment-based discount, removes barrier

**Skool Implementation**:

**Structure:** Free community + One-time onboarding fee + Two subscription tiers (high monthly + low monthly with commitment)

**Setup:**

1. **Free community** (entry point)
2. **Expensive one-time onboarding purchase** (e.g., $2000-$5000)
   - Includes: Setup, intake calls, onboarding, custom work
3. **Two monthly subscription options:**
   - **Option A (High Monthly):** $500/mo + $3000 onboarding fee
   - **Option B (Low Monthly):** $300/mo, NO onboarding fee (if commit to 12 months)

**How It Works:**

**Path 1 (No Commitment):**
- Customer wants flexibility (month-to-month)
- Pays $3000 onboarding upfront
- Pays $500/mo ongoing
- Can cancel anytime

**Path 2 (With Commitment):**
- Customer commits to 12 months
- NO onboarding fee (waived = $3000 saved)
- Pays $300/mo ($3600 total for year)
- **Net:** $3600 vs. $9000 ($3000 + $6000 for Path 1)

**The Value Proposition:**
"If you want me to take the risk (of doing expensive onboarding work), you've got to pay upfront. If you're going to take some risk by committing to a longer period, I'll match your risk by lowering the rate AND waiving the onboarding fee."

**Implementation Steps:**

1. **Create free community**
2. **Create expensive one-time "onboarding" purchase** in classroom ($3000)
   - Include real work: Setup, calls, custom templates, onboarding sequence
3. **Create two subscription tiers:**
   - **Tier 1:** $500/mo (requires $3000 onboarding purchase first)
   - **Tier 2:** $300/mo (no onboarding fee, requires 12-month commitment)
4. **When prospect inquires:**
   - Show both options
   - Explain: "If you want month-to-month flexibility, there's upfront work I need to do, so $3000 + $500/mo"
   - "If you commit to 12 months, I'll waive the $3000 and lower the monthly to $300"
5. **Handle commitments:**
   - Commitment is based on trust (not enforced by Skool)
   - Works best with reliable customers

**Hormozi's Important Caveat:**
> "Like all businesses, and this has nothing to do with Skool, any commitment is only as good as the word of the person giving it to you."

**When This Works Best:**
- Customers with real assets (not cheap skates)
- Services with front-loaded work (setup, onboarding, custom builds)
- Businesses where results take time
- Higher-ticket offers ($300+ monthly)

**When This Doesn't Work:**
> "If you have a bunch of cheap skates or people who don't have a lot of money or are not very reliable for payment, or maybe you're not that good at providing value on a consistent basis, then this offer will not have nearly the effect."

**The Underlying Mechanism:**
"Fundamentally you're saying: If you want ME to take the risk, you pay upfront. If YOU take some risk by committing longer, I'll match your risk by lowering the rate."

**Example for CCGG:**
- Path 1: $2000 onboarding (custom AI strategy session + implementation roadmap) + $297/mo
- Path 2: $197/mo for 12 months (waive $2000 onboarding)
- Commitment-based customers save $2000 and get lower monthly

**Key Consideration:**
Only use if you genuinely have front-loaded work (onboarding, setup, custom strategy). Don't fake it.
