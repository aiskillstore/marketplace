      {
        "question": "Can I use npm or yarn instead of pnpm?",

      {
        "question": "Is my data safe when running these scripts?",

      {
        "question": "How does this compare to writing raw HTML artifacts?",
        "answer": "This approach enables modern development practices, component reuse, and access to the shadcn/ui design system at the cost of increased bundle size."
