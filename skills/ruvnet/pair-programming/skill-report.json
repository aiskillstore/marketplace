    "faq": [
      {
        "question": "What is the difference between driver mode and navigator mode?",
        "answer": "Driver mode means you write the code while AI provides guidance and suggestions. Navigator mode means AI writes the code while you provide high-level direction and review. Choose driver when learning or controlling implementation details, navigator for rapid prototyping or code generation."
      },
      {
        "question": "How does automatic role switching work in switch mode?",
        "answer": "Switch mode automatically alternates between driver and navigator roles at configurable intervals. You receive a 30-second warning before switching, complete your current thought, then roles swap with a context summary to maintain continuity. Default interval is 10 minutes."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is truth score verification and when should I use it?",
        "answer": "Truth score is a quality metric from 0 to 1 that evaluates code correctness, test coverage, and best practices. Enable verification with high thresholds for critical code. Scores above 0.95 are good, above 0.98 are excellent. Failed verification can trigger automatic rollback."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I use this skill without installing claude-flow CLI?",
        "answer": "No, this skill is documentation for the claude-flow CLI tool. You must install claude-flow CLI separately using npm install command. The skill provides comprehensive usage instructions and command references but does not execute commands directly."
      },
      {
        "question": "How does TDD mode differ from regular development modes?",
        "answer": "TDD mode enforces test-driven development workflow with three phases: write failing test, implement minimal code to pass, then refactor. It requires tests before implementation and tracks coverage goals. Use TDD mode when building new features with comprehensive testing requirements."
      },
      {
        "question": "What AI agent personalities are available and when should I use each?",
        "answer": "Available agents include senior-dev for architecture and patterns, tdd-specialist for testing focus, debugger-expert for problem solving, and junior-dev for learning. Choose based on task needs: senior-dev for refactoring, debugger-expert for fixing issues, tdd-specialist for test coverage."
