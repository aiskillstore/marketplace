The detected patterns are false positives - the skill uses GitHub CLI for standard PR operations, network access is limited to GitHub API, and credential access is necessary for authenticated GitHub operations. The static analyzer flagged documentation examples of security checks (like Windows SAM patterns) as if the skill itself accessed those systems, which is incorrect. All external commands use hardcoded GitHub CLI tools with validated inputs.",
