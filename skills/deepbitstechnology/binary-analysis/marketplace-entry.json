  "description": "Analyze binary files (exe, dll, sys, bin, ocx, scr, cpl, drv) to assess if they are malicious, perform decompilation, extract strings/imports/exports, detect malware, and provide threat assessment. Use this skill when user asks to analyze, examine, check, or assess any binary file, asks if a file is malicious/suspicious/safe, or provides a file path to a binary. Trigger for phrases like \"Is [file] malicious?\", \"Analyze [file]\", \"What does [binary] do?\", or any request involving binary file analysis.",
