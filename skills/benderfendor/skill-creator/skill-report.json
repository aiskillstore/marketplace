      },
      {
        "question": "When should I use scripts versus references?",
        "answer": "Use scripts for code that needs deterministic execution or is repeatedly rewritten. Use references for documentation that Codex should read to inform its process. Scripts can execute without loading into context, while references are loaded as needed."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I decide between high, medium, or low freedom in my instructions?",
        "answer": "Use low freedom (specific scripts) when operations are fragile and consistency is critical. Use medium freedom (parameterized scripts) when some variation is acceptable. Use high freedom (text instructions) when multiple valid approaches exist and context should guide the approach."
      },
      {
        "question": "What validation does package_skill.py perform?",
        "answer": "The packaging script validates YAML frontmatter format and required fields, checks skill naming conventions and directory structure, verifies description completeness, and ensures proper file organization and resource references before creating the .skill package."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I trigger a skill in Codex?",
        "answer": "Skills are triggered based on their name and description in the YAML frontmatter. Write a clear description that includes specific triggers, file types, or scenarios that should activate the skill. Codex reads these fields to determine when to use each skill."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I update an existing skill using this guide?",
        "answer": "Yes, the skill-creator guide applies to both creating new skills and updating existing ones. Skip the initialization step and proceed directly to editing the skill contents. The packaging step validates your changes before distribution."
