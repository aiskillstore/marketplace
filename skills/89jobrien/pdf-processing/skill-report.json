        "question": "Can I edit existing text content in a PDF?",

      {
        "question": "What is form flattening and when should I use it?",

        "question": "How accurate is table extraction from PDFs?",
        "answer": "Table extraction accuracy depends on how well-structured the PDF is. Tables with clear borders and consistent formatting extract well, while complex or poorly formatted tables may require manual adjustment of extraction settings."
