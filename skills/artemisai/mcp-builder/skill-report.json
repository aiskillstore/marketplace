The 'weak cryptographic algorithm' detections in documentation files are pattern matches on words like 'md5' appearing in text/code examples. The 'external command' findings are documentation examples showing how to run MCP servers for testing (e.g., 'python server.py'). Environment variable access is standard practice for API authentication configuration. The critical heuristic about 'Code execution + Network + Credential access' is a false positive - this is legitimate documentation that naturally involves all three patterns for building and testing MCP servers. No malicious intent, data exfiltration, or harmful patterns detected.",
