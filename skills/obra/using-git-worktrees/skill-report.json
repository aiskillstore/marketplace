The patterns detected (shell commands, filesystem paths) are standard git operations with hardcoded arguments in documentation format. The 'C2 keywords' alerts are triggered by common computing terms like 'command' and 'control' in version control context. The 'weak cryptographic algorithm' alerts misinterpret text content (SHA256 hashes, words like 'encrypt') as code. This skill teaches safe git practices with proper safety verification using git check-ignore.",
