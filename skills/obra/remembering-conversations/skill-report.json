    "faq": [
      {
        "question": "What conversations does this skill search?",

      },
      {
        "question": "How does this skill differ from using Grep or Read directly?",
        "answer": "The search agent understands semantic meaning, not just text matching. It can find conversations about related concepts even when the exact words differ. It also synthesizes findings rather than returning raw data."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can this skill modify or delete my conversation history?",
        "answer": "No. This skill only has read access to search and display past conversations. It cannot delete, edit, or archive conversations. Those operations require separate tools."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is my conversation data sent to external servers?",
        "answer": "No. All conversations are stored locally on your machine. The search operation happens against your local database. No data is transmitted externally."
      },
      {
        "question": "How accurate is the semantic search?",
        "answer": "The skill uses sqlite-vec with embeddings for semantic similarity and SQLite FTS5 for text matching. Accuracy depends on query specificity and embedding quality. Combining both modes provides the best results."
      },
      {
        "question": "What affects search performance?",
        "answer": "Search itself is fast (typically under 100ms). Reading full conversations takes longer for large files. Use startLine and endLine parameters to limit the range when you know approximately where the relevant content is located."
