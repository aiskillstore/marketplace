        "question": "Do I need to create the docs/plans directory manually?",

      {
        "question": "Can I customize the task granularity in the plans?",
        "answer": "The skill follows a 2-5 minute task granularity by default for optimal workflow. This is based on TDD best practices and keeps tasks focused and testable."

      {
        "question": "What programming languages does this skill support?",

        "question": "How do I execute a plan after it is created?",
        "answer": "After creation, you have two options. Use subagent-driven-development in the same session for iterative execution with review between tasks, or open a new session with executing-plans for batch execution with checkpoints."
