      {
        "question": "Can I skip the spec compliance review?",

      {
        "question": "What if a subagent asks questions during work?",

      {
        "question": "How do I handle a failing subagent?",

      {
        "question": "What makes tasks suitable for this skill?",
        "answer": "Tasks should be independent and mostly self-contained. Tightly coupled tasks that depend on each other should be combined into a single task."

      {
        "question": "How many review iterations should I expect?",
        "answer": "One to three iterations is normal. The review loop catches issues early when they're cheapest to fix. Don't skip re-review just because it adds iterations."
