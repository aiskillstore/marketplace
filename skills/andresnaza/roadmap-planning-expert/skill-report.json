A 2-week sprint has 10 working days, and this model includes a built-in 15% buffer for unexpected work, meetings, and context switching. For example, a team of 3 developers would have 60 points of capacity per sprint."
      },
      {
        "input": "How should I size milestones within an epic?",
        "output": "Milestones should be sized according to these guidelines: Small milestones are 5-8 points taking about 1 week, Medium milestones are 10-15 points taking 1.5-2 weeks, and Large milestones are 18-25 points taking a full sprint. Any milestone over 25 points should be split into smaller milestones. Each epic should contain 2-4 milestones that represent meaningful checkpoints, not just task lists."
      },
      {
        "input": "Explain the planning hierarchy for roadmaps.",
        "output": "The planning hierarchy has four levels: Quarter (6 sprints of strategic planning), Epic (major feature or initiative living in one file), Milestone (meaningful checkpoint within an epic, 2-4 per epic), and Sprint (2-week execution window). For example, a quarter might contain Epic A with 3 milestones allocated to Sprints 1-3, and Epic B with 2 milestones in Sprints 2 and 4. This hierarchy keeps strategic planning separate from detailed execution tracking."

    "best_practices": [
      "Include a 15% capacity buffer in sprint planning to account for unexpected work and avoid over-commitment",

    "anti_patterns": [
      "Do not treat milestones as detailed task lists - they should be coarse checkpoints suitable for capacity planning",
      "Avoid allocating 100% of team capacity to planned work without buffer for interruptions and uncertainty",
      "Do not create epics or milestones without estimating points - unestimated work cannot be planned into sprints"

    "faq": [
      {
        "question": "How does this skill differ from project management tools like ClickUp?",
        "answer": "This skill provides strategic planning methodology and capacity guidance, while tools like ClickUp handle detailed execution tracking. The skill helps you plan what to build and when, but you still need project management tools for daily task tracking, pull requests, and QA workflows."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is the difference between an epic and a milestone?",
        "answer": "An epic is a large strategic initiative or feature that lives in one file throughout its lifecycle. A milestone is a meaningful checkpoint within an epic, with 2-4 milestones per epic. Milestones are sized for capacity planning and allocated to specific sprints."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I customize the capacity model for my team?",
        "answer": "Yes, the default model of 20 points per developer per 2-week sprint is a starting point. You can adjust based on your team's velocity, context switching overhead, and meeting load. The key is to include realistic buffers and track actuals over time."
      },
      {
        "question": "How many milestones should I plan per sprint?",
        "answer": "This depends on your team capacity and milestone sizes. For a 3-developer team with 60 points capacity, you might plan 3-4 medium milestones, or 2 large milestones, or a mix. Always leave buffer capacity and avoid over-committing to exactly 60 points."
      },
      {
        "question": "Does this skill create files or integrate with tools automatically?",
        "answer": "No, this is a guidance and methodology skill. It provides expert advice on planning structure, capacity calculations, and workflows, but you need to implement the recommended file structure and tool integrations manually or with other Claude Code capabilities."
      },
      {
        "question": "What does collaborative planning mean in this skill?",
        "answer": "Collaborative planning means the skill asks you questions about goals, priorities, and constraints rather than making decisions automatically. For example, when planning a quarter, it asks about your strategic objectives and helps you define epics together rather than generating a plan unilaterally."
