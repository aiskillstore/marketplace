The static scanner detected shell patterns (command substitution, backticks, external commands) but these are all in documentation examples showing how to write scripts safely. The content explicitly teaches security best practices including avoiding eval with untrusted input, using mktemp for temp files, and not storing secrets in scripts. No executable code, file access, or network operations exist - only educational examples demonstrating proper shell scripting techniques.",
