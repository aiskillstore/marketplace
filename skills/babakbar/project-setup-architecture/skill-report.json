    "faq": [
      {
        "question": "Does this skill work with plain React Native or only Expo projects?",
        "answer": "This skill is optimized for Expo projects but most concepts apply to plain React Native. The main differences are package installation commands and configuration file structures. For plain React Native, replace expo install with npm install and adjust configuration files accordingly."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I use a different state management library instead of Zustand?",
        "answer": "Yes, the architectural patterns work with any state management library. Zustand is recommended for its simplicity and TypeScript support, but you can substitute Redux Toolkit, Jotai, or React Context. The directory structure and setup approach remain the same."
      },
      {
        "question": "Do I need to follow the exact directory structure suggested?",
        "answer": "No, the feature-sliced architecture is a recommendation. You can adapt the structure to your needs. The key principles are separating concerns, grouping related code, and maintaining consistency across your project."
      },
      {
        "question": "What if I want to use a different database instead of SQLite?",
        "answer": "For React Native mobile apps, SQLite is the standard for local storage. For backend databases, you would connect via API endpoints. If you need a different local database, consider WatermelonDB or Realm, though setup steps will differ significantly."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I add navigation setup to this configuration?",
        "answer": "Install React Navigation with npx expo install @react-navigation/native @react-navigation/stack and required dependencies. Create a navigation directory under src/app and define your screen routes. The skill focuses on foundational setup but navigation integrates naturally with this structure."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can Claude Code automatically run these setup commands for me?",
        "answer": "Yes, Claude Code can execute the bash commands shown in this guide using the Bash tool. However, it is recommended to review each step and verify the setup works before proceeding to the next component to catch any compatibility issues early."
