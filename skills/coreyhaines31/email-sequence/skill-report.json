Lead nurture sequences typically need 5-10 emails spread over 2-3 weeks. Re-engagement sequences can be shorter at 3-4 emails over 10-14 days. Focus on value over volume."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is the best timing between emails?",
        "answer": "Welcome emails should be immediate. Early sequence emails work best 1-2 days apart. Nurture sequences can space emails 2-4 days apart. Long-term sequences may go weekly or bi-weekly. B2B audiences typically prefer avoiding weekends while B2C may see success with weekend sends."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I know if my email sequence is working?",
        "answer": "Track open rates (benchmark 20-40%), click rates (benchmark 2-5%), unsubscribe rate (keep under 0.5%), and conversion rate tied to your sequence goal. Test subject lines against benchmarks and iterate based on performance data. A/B test one variable at a time for clear results."
      },
      {
        "question": "Should every email in a sequence have a CTA?",
        "answer": "Yes, but each email should have one primary CTA. Secondary actions can be in-text links. The CTA should be clear about what to do next and what outcome to expect. Avoid competing CTAs that split reader attention."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I segment email audiences?",
        "answer": "Segment by behavior (openers, clickers, inactive), stage (trial vs. paid, new vs. long-term), and profile (industry, role, company size). Use merge fields for personalization and triggered sends based on specific actions or milestones."

      {
