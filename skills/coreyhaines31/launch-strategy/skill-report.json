      "Start building owned channels (email list, blog, community) early as they compound in value over time and reduce dependency on platform algorithms.",

      "Always convert borrowed and rented attention into owned relationships through email capture and direct engagement."

      "Relying solely on rented channels like social media without building owned audience assets creates vulnerability to algorithm changes.",

    "faq": [
      {
        "question": "What is the ORB framework in launch strategy?",
        "answer": "The ORB framework categorizes marketing channels into Owned (email, blog, community), Rented (social media, app stores), and Borrowed (guest content, influencer partnerships). Successful launches use all three but prioritize Owned channels for long-term stability."
      },
      {
        "question": "How long should a product launch take?",
        "answer": "A complete launch typically spans 8-12 weeks across five phases: Internal testing, Alpha launch, Beta launch, Early Access, and Full launch. However, timeline varies based on product readiness and audience size."
      },
      {
        "question": "When should I use Product Hunt for my launch?",
        "answer": "Product Hunt works best for B2B SaaS and consumer apps targeting early adopters. It requires significant preparation including community building, listing optimization, and all-day engagement commitment. Not suitable for enterprise or niche B2B products."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I maintain momentum after launch day?",
        "answer": "Post-launch momentum comes from consistent follow-up content, email sequences for new users, comparison pages against competitors, and planning the next launch moment within 4-6 weeks to capitalize on attention."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is the difference between major, medium, and minor updates?",
        "answer": "Major updates (new features, overhauls) deserve full multi-channel campaigns. Medium updates (integrations, UI changes) need targeted announcements to affected users. Minor updates (bug fixes) should be communicated through changelogs without dominating marketing attention."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I prioritize my launch channels?",
        "answer": "Start with your strongest owned channel where you have direct audience access. Add one rented channel where your audience is active. Use borrowed channels strategically for credibility boosts. Always funnel attention back to owned assets for lasting relationships."
