        "question": "How much budget do I need to start?",
        "answer": "Platform minimums vary. Meta and Google require minimum daily budgets of $1-5 per ad set. For meaningful data, aim for at least $50-100 daily across 1-2 campaigns to reach statistical significance within a week."
      },
      {
        "question": "How long does it take to see results?",
        "answer": "Initial learning phase takes 3-7 days as algorithms optimize. Plan for 2-4 weeks of testing before making final optimization decisions. Significant scaling results typically show after 4-8 weeks."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is a good ROAS or CPA benchmark?",
        "answer": "Benchmarks vary by industry and product price point. E-commerce typically targets 3-5x ROAS. B2B looks at target CPA relative to customer LTV. Compare against your own unit economics rather than generic benchmarks."
      },
      {
        "question": "Should I use manual or automated bidding?",
        "answer": "Start with manual or cost caps when gathering conversion data (50+ conversions needed). Switch to automated bidding (Target CPA, Target ROAS) once you have reliable historical performance data for the algorithm to learn from."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I handle ad fatigue?",
        "answer": "Monitor frequency metrics and creative performance over time. When CTR drops and frequency rises, refresh creative with new angles, images, or messages. Test new creative every 2-4 weeks for active campaigns."
