        "question": "Does this skill change my brand voice?",

      {
        "question": "How does this skill differ from proofreading?",
        "answer": "Copy editing goes far beyond proofreading. It evaluates strategy, messaging effectiveness, emotional resonance, and persuasive power—not just grammar, spelling, and typos."
