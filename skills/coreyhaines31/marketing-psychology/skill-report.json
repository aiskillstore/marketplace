        "question": "What is the difference between marketing psychology and behavioral economics?",

For marketing purposes, they overlap significantly. This skill draws from both fields to provide practical frameworks."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are these psychological principles ethical to use?",
        "answer": "Yes, these principles describe how people naturally think and decide. Using them ethically means helping customers make decisions they would make anyway, just more clearly. The skill emphasizes authentic scarcity, genuine value demonstration, and respect for customer autonomy."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I know which mental model to apply?",
        "answer": "Start with your specific challenge: low conversions, price objections, urgency, or retention. The Quick Reference table in SKILL.md maps challenges to relevant models. You can also ask the skill directly which models apply to your situation."
      },
      {
        "question": "Do these principles work across different cultures?",
        "answer": "Some principles are universal (loss aversion, reciprocity) while others vary by culture. The skill provides foundational models; adapt them based on your specific audience and test with real customers from that culture."
      },
      {
        "question": "How many psychological principles should I apply at once?",
        "answer": "Focus on 2-3 principles that directly address your specific challenge. Applying too many creates confusion. The Paradox of Choice applies to messaging too. Test systematically rather than overwhelming users."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can these models predict campaign outcomes?",
        "answer": "These models explain why certain approaches work but do not predict specific outcomes. They increase probability of success based on behavioral science research. Always test with real customers through A/B testing or experiments."
