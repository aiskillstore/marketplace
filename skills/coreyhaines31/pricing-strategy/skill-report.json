      {
        "question": "How many pricing tiers should I have?",

        "question": "What is the difference between freemium and free trial?",
        "answer": "Freemium is a permanent free tier with limited features. Free trial is time-limited full access. Freemium works for viral products with low serving costs. Free trial works for complex products that need demonstration."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I know if my prices are too low?",
        "answer": "Signs prices are too low include: very high conversion rates, customer feedback about being cheap, competitors charging more, and customers using more than they pay for. Research shows 25-50% higher prices are often achievable."
      },
      {
        "question": "What value metric should I use?",
        "answer": "A good value metric scales with customer value, is easy to understand, and is hard to game. Common options include per user (collaboration), per usage (infrastructure), per record (CRM), and revenue share (high-value outcomes)."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I communicate a price increase to customers?",
        "answer": "Be transparent about why, give advance notice, grandfather existing customers if possible, and tie the increase to new value delivered. Provide a deadline for locking in old rates to drive action."
      },
      {
        "question": "Should I offer annual pricing discounts?",
        "answer": "Yes, annual discounts of 17-20% improve cash flow and reduce churn. This works because annual commits lock in customers and improve your revenue predictability."
