Show only the top 5 differentiators per plan\n2. **Add an ROI calculator** - let users see their value, not just your price\n3. **Create a \"which plan\" guide** - FAQ answering common plan selection questions\n\n## Test Ideas\n\n1. Remove the lowest tier and test 2 plans vs 3 plans\n2. Show enterprise pricing (even if \"contact us\") to anchor the upper range\n3. Test \"per month\" vs \"per user per month\" language"

Try: \"[Specific Outcome] in [Timeframe] without [Pain Point]\"\n3. **Add a single primary CTA above fold** - current may have competing actions\n\n## High-Impact Changes (Prioritize)\n\n1. **Create a new hero section** - leading with the #1 customer outcome, not features\n2. **Implement sticky nav** with persistent CTA for users who scroll\n3. **Add trust signals earlier** - logos or social proof in hero area\n\n## Test Ideas\n\n1.
