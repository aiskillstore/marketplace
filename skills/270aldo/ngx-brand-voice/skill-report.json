      {
        "question": "When should I use Mode A versus Mode B or Mode C?",
        "answer": "Use Mode A for educational content, Mode B for relationship-building and ongoing communication, and Mode C for conversion-focused messaging like sales pages or calls to action. Each mode maintains Verdad Directa while adjusting tone for context."

        "question": "How do I adapt content for different age segments?",
        "answer": "The skill provides specific adaptation strategies for 30-45 and 45-60 age groups. Younger audiences respond to innovation and efficiency, while older segments value proven results and risk mitigation. Reference the audience adaptation documentation for detailed guidelines."

      {
        "question": "Can I use this skill for brands other than NGX?",
        "answer": "This skill contains NGX-specific brand guidelines and examples. While the communication principles may be instructive, the content is tailored to NGX voice and should not be directly applied to other brands without significant adaptation."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is the CONFRONTA-FUNDAMENTA-RESUELVE formula?",
        "answer": "This is a conversion copywriting structure: CONFRONTA presents the problem directly, FUNDAMENTA provides evidence or proof, and RESUELVE offers the concrete solution. It aligns with Verdad Directa by being transparent about challenges and solutions."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is this skill only for Spanish language content?",
        "answer": "Yes, the NGX brand voice guidelines and examples are designed for Spanish language content. The principles could inform content in other languages, but all documentation and examples are in Spanish."
