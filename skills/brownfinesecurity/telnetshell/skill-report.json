The tool explicitly identifies as a pentesting skill and includes authorization requirements. The flagged patterns (password file access, SSH key enumeration, sudoers file access) are standard security enumeration commands used in authorized penetration testing. Risk level is MEDIUM because powerful capabilities require proper user authorization.",
