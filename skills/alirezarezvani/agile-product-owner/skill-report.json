    "faq": [
      {
        "question": "How does the tool ensure stories follow INVEST criteria?",
        "answer": "The generator validates each story against INVEST principles: Independent (no dependencies), Negotiable (flexible scope), Valuable (clear benefit), Estimable (can be sized), Small (fits in sprint), and Testable (has acceptance criteria). Stories are automatically structured with persona-based templates and acceptance criteria patterns."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I customize the personas and story templates?",
        "answer": "Yes, the user_story_generator.py script includes predefined personas (end_user, admin, power_user, new_user) and story templates that can be extended. You can modify the personas dictionary and story_templates to match your product's specific user types and organizational standards."
      },
      {
        "question": "How are story points estimated automatically?",
        "answer": "The tool uses complexity indicators like number of acceptance criteria, integration requirements, and persona scope to suggest story points. These automated estimates should be reviewed and adjusted by the team during backlog refinement based on their velocity and technical context."
      },
      {
        "question": "What sprint planning features are included?",
        "answer": "The sprint planning mode allows you to specify team capacity in story points and automatically selects and prioritizes stories to maximize value delivery within that capacity. It tracks velocity, maintains capacity buffers, and provides sprint metrics for data-driven planning."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I integrate this with my existing project management tools?",
        "answer": "The tool generates structured JSON output that can be imported into tools like Jira, Azure DevOps, or Trello through their APIs or CSV import features. While not a direct integration, the standardized output format facilitates easy data transfer to your preferred platform."
