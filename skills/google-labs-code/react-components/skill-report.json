        "question": "Why does the skill use a bash script instead of standard HTTP requests?",

      {
        "question": "What does the AST validation check for?",

      {
        "question": "Can I customize the generated component structure?",

      },
      {
        "question": "What if the Stitch download URL expires?",
        "answer": "Stitch URLs are signed and time-limited. If a fetch fails, the skill will report the error and you may need to regenerate the design export in Stitch to get a fresh URL."
