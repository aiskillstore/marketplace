It reads environment variables for SMTP configuration, reads AGENTS.md for optional project name extraction, and sends task completion notifications via standard Python smtplib. All detected patterns are expected functionality - email sending is the stated purpose, environment access is for configuration, and filesystem reads are for project name resolution. No malicious behavior confirmed.",
