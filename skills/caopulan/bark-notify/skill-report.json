The scanner misinterpreted YAML frontmatter fields as 'weak cryptographic algorithms', bash escaping quotes as 'path traversal sequences', and standard config file paths as 'hidden file' access. This is a legitimate notification utility that reads environment variables for API configuration, reads project metadata from AGENTS.md files, and sends push notifications to the official Bark API (api.day.app). The credential access pattern is explicitly documented and required for the skill's intended function.",
