      {

        "answer": "Bruno files are API test definitions with .bru extension that specify HTTP requests including method, URL, headers, parameters, and body. This skill parses these files to understand the API contract and then searches your Django codebase to find the implementation and generate comprehensive documentation."

      {
        "question": "Does this work with Django REST Framework and Django Ninja?",
        "answer": "Yes, the skill supports both frameworks. It identifies ViewSets, serializers, and permission classes for DRF endpoints, and routers, Pydantic schemas, and auth decorators for Django Ninja endpoints. Implementation details are tailored to each framework."
      },
      {
        "question": "How does the skill find the backend implementation code?",
        "answer": "The skill uses URL pattern matching conventions. For /api/v2/ endpoints it checks dashboardapp/v2_urls.py and dashboardapp/views/v2/. For /api/v2/pulse/ it checks pulse_iq/api/. For other paths it searches app-level urls.py files and uses Grep to find matching URL patterns."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I customize the documentation output format?",
        "answer": "The skill generates markdown with a fixed structure including Overview, Request, Response, Implementation Details, Business Logic, Frontend Integration, Testing, and Notes sections. You can edit the output markdown file after generation to customize formatting or add additional sections."
      },
      {
        "question": "What if the skill cannot find my endpoint implementation?",
        "answer": "The skill will add a [BLOCKING] severity tag and explain what it searched for. You can help by ensuring your URL patterns follow Django conventions, or manually specify the view file location for the skill to analyze."

      {
        "question": "Does this skill work with Claude Code and OpenAI Codex?",
        "answer": "Yes, the skill is compatible with both tools. Claude Code users install via /plugin install bruno-api@diversiotech and invoke with /bruno-api:docs.
