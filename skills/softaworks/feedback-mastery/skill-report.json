I want to understand what is going on and how we can get back to our usual quality.'\n\n**Option 3 - Process-focused:**\n'Let us talk about our testing process. I have seen a few bugs slip through recently and want to understand if something in our setup is making it harder to catch them.'\n\nAvoid starting with 'You always...' or 'Your code has bugs.'

    "faq": [
      {
        "question": "What is the SBI feedback model?",
        "answer": "SBI stands for Situation-Behavior-Impact. It is a structured approach to giving feedback: describe the specific Situation (when and where), the observable Behavior (what they did), and the Impact (effect on team or project). This framework makes feedback specific, objective, and actionable while reducing defensiveness."
      },
      {
        "question": "When should I use this skill?",
        "answer": "Use this skill when preparing for difficult conversations, giving constructive feedback, addressing performance issues, navigating conflicts, managing expectations with stakeholders, or receiving feedback yourself. It is designed for workplace communication challenges."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I handle someone who gets defensive?",
        "answer": "Stay curious and acknowledge their perspective. Use phrases like 'I want to understand. Can you walk me through what happened from your perspective?' or 'I believe you had good intentions. Let us talk about the impact regardless of intent.' The skill includes specific response scripts for defensiveness, deflection, emotion, and denial."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can this skill help with positive feedback too?",
        "answer": "Yes. The SBI model works excellently for positive recognition. Specific praise like 'During Tuesday's code review (Situation), you caught the edge case that would have caused data loss (Behavior), which prevented a costly production bug (Impact)' is more meaningful than generic 'good job' comments."
      },
      {
        "question": "What if the person denies the behavior happened?",
        "answer": "Focus on specifics. Respond with 'I want to make sure we are talking about the same situation. [Describe specific instance with details]. Does that match your recollection?' Having concrete examples with dates, times, or PR numbers makes the feedback harder to dismiss."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I give feedback to my manager or someone senior to me?",
        "answer": "The same frameworks apply. Focus on impact to the project or team rather than personal preferences. Use phrases like 'I want to make sure we deliver something great, and I have some concerns about...' or 'Can we clarify expectations on...?' The skill includes scripts for pushing back on unrealistic deadlines and managing up."
