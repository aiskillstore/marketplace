        "question": "What plugin patterns are supported?",
        "answer": "The skill supports three patterns: Framework plugins for framework-specific guidance, Utility plugins for tools and commands, and Domain plugins for domain-specific knowledge. Each has a recommended directory structure documented in the references."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I test my plugin before publishing?",
        "answer": "Use the /plugin marketplace add command to add your local marketplace root, then install your plugin with /plugin install plugin-name@marketplace-name. Make changes, uninstall, and reinstall to test updates."
      },
      {
        "question": "What happens if I forget to bump the version?",
        "answer": "Claude Code may cache the old version. Always bump the version when making changes, even for documentation updates, to ensure users get the latest version."

      {
        "question": "Can I convert an existing skill into a plugin?",
        "answer": "Yes. Create a new plugin structure, then move your SKILL.md into the skills/ directory. Update the plugin.json with appropriate metadata and register it in marketplace.json."
