    "summary": "Legitimate browser automation skill using Playwright. Medium risk due to browser control capabilities which inherently allow navigation to arbitrary URLs and interaction with web content. Static findings are mostly false positives from documentation examples being misidentified as executable code. The 'weak cryptographic algorithm' alerts are triggered by the word 'Playwright' in filenames - not actual crypto usage. The 'Ruby/shell backtick execution' alerts flag bash command examples in markdown documentation, not actual backtick usage.",
