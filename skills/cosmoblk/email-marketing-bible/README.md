# Email Marketing Bible — Claude Code Skill

The most comprehensive email marketing knowledge base, built for Claude Code.

55,000 words. 908 sources. 4,798 insights. 40 expert contributors. 19 industry playbooks. Distilled into a single skill file that turns Claude into an email marketing expert.

Built by [George Hartley](https://x.com/GTHartley) (founder of SmartrMail — email marketing SaaS, 28,000 customers).

## Why this exists

Most email marketing advice is surface-level. "Personalise your subject lines." "Segment your list." "A/B test everything." You've heard it. It doesn't help when you're staring at a 2% open rate wondering what's actually broken.

This skill gives Claude the same knowledge that comes from running an email platform serving 28,000 customers — the patterns that repeat across industries, the mistakes that destroy campaigns, and the specific strategies that consistently generate outsized returns.

Every claim is backed by data. Every recommendation has been tested by practitioners. No theory. No filler. Specific things you can implement this week.

## Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/CosmoBlk/email-marketing-bible.git ~/.claude/skills/email-marketing-bible
```

That's it. One command. Claude now has access to the full knowledge base.

## What the skill does

Once installed, Claude can:

| Task | What it does |
|------|-------------|
| **Audit your setup** | Review your current email marketing stack — flows, segments, deliverability, compliance — and tell you exactly what's missing |
| **Draft email copy** | Write emails using proven frameworks (PAS, AIDA, Before-After-Bridge) with subject lines, preview text, body copy, and CTAs |
| **Build automation flows** | Design welcome series, abandoned cart, post-purchase, win-back, sunset, and nurture sequences with timing and triggers |
| **Pull industry benchmarks** | Get open rates, click rates, conversion rates, and revenue-per-email for your specific vertical |
| **Fix deliverability** | Diagnose inbox placement issues with a 10-step framework covering authentication, reputation, content, and infrastructure |
| **Compare platforms** | Get honest platform comparisons based on your list size, budget, and use case — not affiliate commissions |
| **Review compliance** | Check your setup against GDPR, CAN-SPAM, CASL, CCPA, and the Australian Spam Act |
| **Write cold email** | Build cold outreach sequences with proper infrastructure separation, warming, and personalisation |

## How to use it with Claude

Install the skill, then talk to Claude like you would an email marketing consultant. Here are some examples:

**Review your current email marketing:**
```
"Review my current email setup. I'm running Klaviyo for a DTC skincare brand,
doing about $2M/year. I have a welcome series, abandoned cart, and one weekly
newsletter. What am I missing?"
```

**Fix a specific problem:**
```
"My emails are landing in Gmail promotions tab and my open rates dropped from
22% to 14% over the last 3 months. What's going on and how do I fix it?"
```

**Build flows from scratch:**
```
"Build me a complete post-purchase email sequence for my Shopify store. I sell
premium coffee. Average order is $45, repeat purchase cycle is 30-45 days."
```

**Get industry-specific advice:**
```
"I'm launching a B2B SaaS product. What does my email marketing stack need
to look like from day one? Give me the flows, segments, and metrics I should
be tracking."
```

**Draft copy:**
```
"Write a win-back email sequence for subscribers who haven't opened in 90 days.
My brand voice is casual and direct. We sell fitness equipment."
```

Claude will pull from 55,000 words of research, benchmarks, frameworks, and real case studies to give you specific, actionable advice — not generic platitudes.
