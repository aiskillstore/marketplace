The scanner misidentifies secure code examples as vulnerabilities. For example, the CRITICAL heuristic flagging 'Code execution + Network + Credential access' is actually the skill demonstrating best practice: using process.env for credentials rather than hardcoding them. Environment variable references show proper secure credential handling, not credential exposure. The external command detections are markdown code fences containing TypeScript examples, not actual shell commands. All URLs are legitimate documentation links. No executable code, scripts, or file operations exist.",
