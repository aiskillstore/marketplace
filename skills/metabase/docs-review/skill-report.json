      {
        "question": "How does the skill decide between PR review mode and local review mode?",
        "answer": "The skill automatically detects if GitHub MCP tools are available. If the mcp github create pending pull request review tool is available, it uses PR mode and posts comments to GitHub. Otherwise, it outputs numbered feedback in the conversation."

      {
        "question": "Why are all issues numbered sequentially?",
        "answer": "Sequential numbering allows efficient reference and tracking. Users can say fix issues 1, 3, and 5 and clearly know which feedback items to address without ambiguity."

      {
        "question": "Does this skill fix documentation issues automatically?",
        "answer": "No, this skill only reviews and identifies issues. It provides numbered feedback with suggested fixes that users can apply manually. This preserves author intent and context-specific decisions."

      {
        "question": "Can this skill verify technical accuracy of documentation content?",
        "answer": "No, this skill focuses on writing style, tone, structure, and formatting. It does not verify factual accuracy, code examples functionality, or technical correctness of the documented features."
