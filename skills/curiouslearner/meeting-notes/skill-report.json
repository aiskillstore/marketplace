        "question": "What if action items are unclear during the meeting?",

      {
        "question": "How do I document sensitive discussions?",
        "answer": "Use neutral, factual language without editorializing. Focus on outcomes and action items rather than debate details. For confidential topics, mark notes appropriately and share only with necessary stakeholders. Consider separate documentation for sensitive HR or personnel matters."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I handle meetings with very long discussions?",
        "answer": "Summarize lengthy debates concisely - capture the key arguments and outcome rather than every point made. Link to detailed documentation if it exists. Use bullet points for multiple perspectives. Note 'majority view' or 'decision made after extensive discussion' when relevant."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I capture discussion points that don't lead to decisions?",
        "answer": "Use a 'Parking Lot' section for items discussed but not resolved. Include context about why items were parked, who raised them, and what needs to happen before they can be addressed. This shows thorough documentation while keeping main notes action-oriented."

      {
        "question": "How do I handle participants who talk too much or dominate?",
        "answer": "Document their key points objectively. For action items, redirect: 'So to summarize, [name] will own X by date Y?' For tangents, note them in parking lot. In follow-up, share notes promptly so quieter team members can add missed points."
