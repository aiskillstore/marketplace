      {

      {
        "question": "How do I maintain referential integrity when seeding related tables?",
        "answer": "Always seed parent tables first and store their returned IDs, then use those IDs when creating child records. Use transactions to ensure all related data is created together or rolled back on failure."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I use this skill to seed a production database?",
        "answer": "No, seed data should only be used in development, testing, and staging environments. Production databases should contain only real customer data and never be populated with generated test data."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I make seed data reproducible across team members?",
        "answer": "Set a fixed random seed value using faker.seed(12345) at the start of your seed script. This ensures all team members generate identical test data when running the same seed script."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is the best way to seed large datasets with millions of records?",
        "answer": "Use batch insert methods like createMany in Prisma or bulk_create in Django instead of individual inserts. Wrap operations in transactions and consider using database-native functions for even better performance."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I create realistic relationships between users and orders?",
        "answer": "Create user personas with different behavior patterns like frequent buyers or occasional shoppers, then generate orders matching those patterns. Use weighted random selection to create realistic distribution of order frequencies and values."
