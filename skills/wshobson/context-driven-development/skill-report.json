      {

      },
      {
        "question": "Which artifacts should I create for my project?",
        "answer": "The core artifacts are product.md (what and why), tech-stack.md (with what), workflow.md (how to work), and tracks.md (what's happening). Additional artifacts like product-guidelines.md can be created for communication standards."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I know when to update context artifacts?",
        "answer": "Update context when product vision changes, new features are added or completed, dependencies are added or upgraded, team practices evolve, or workflow patterns are adopted. Always update related artifacts together to maintain synchronization."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is this skill suitable for greenfield or brownfield projects?",
        "answer": "Yes. For greenfield projects, you establish all artifacts from scratch. For brownfield projects, you extract implicit context from existing code and patterns, then establish new standards while preserving working patterns."
      },
      {
        "question": "How does this improve AI-assisted development?",
        "answer": "Structured context produces consistent AI behavior across sessions. Instead of re-explaining requirements each time, AI assistants reference documented standards, leading to more predictable outputs and reduced context switching overhead."
      },
      {
        "question": "Who should be responsible for maintaining context?",
        "answer": "Context maintenance should be collaborative. Include context reviews in pull requests and make updates a team responsibility rather than a single person's task. This ensures all stakeholders contribute to accurate documentation."
