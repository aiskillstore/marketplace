Kubeflow Pipelines is ideal for Kubernetes environments. Prefect provides a developer-friendly Python-first approach. Start with what your team already uses for data workflows."

      {
        "question": "How do I handle model versioning and rollback?",
        "answer": "Use a model registry like MLflow or cloud platform registries to version models with metadata. Implement blue-green or canary deployment strategies that keep previous model versions running. Set up automated health checks and rollback triggers based on performance metrics. Maintain artifacts and configurations for each version to enable quick rollback."

      {
        "question": "What is the difference between batch and real-time ML pipelines?",
        "answer": "Batch pipelines process data and make predictions on a schedule with higher latency but better resource efficiency. Real-time pipelines serve predictions with low latency for individual requests but require more infrastructure. Many production systems use hybrid approaches with real-time serving backed by batch feature engineering and model updates."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I implement data validation in ML pipelines?",
        "answer": "Use libraries like Great Expectations or TensorFlow Data Validation to define data schemas and quality checks. Validate data types, value ranges, distributions, and relationships at pipeline boundaries. Fail fast when validation fails rather than propagating bad data. Log validation results for debugging and monitoring data quality over time."
      },
      {
        "question": "What metrics should I track for ML pipeline health?",
        "answer": "Track pipeline execution time and success rates for each stage. Monitor data volumes and feature distributions for drift detection. Log model performance metrics including accuracy, precision, and recall. Measure prediction latency and throughput for serving. Set up alerts for anomalies and threshold violations."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I test ML pipelines before production deployment?",
        "answer": "Test individual pipeline components with unit tests using sample data. Run integration tests on the full pipeline with realistic datasets. Perform canary deployments with small traffic percentages to validate production behavior. Use shadow deployments to compare new pipelines against existing ones without affecting users. Validate that rollback procedures work correctly."
