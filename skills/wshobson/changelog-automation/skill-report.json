        "question": "How do I handle breaking changes in my commits?",

      {
        "question": "Can I customize which commit types appear in the changelog?",
        "answer": "Yes, all tools support customization. In standard-version use .versionrc.js, in semantic-release use commit-analyzer options, and in git-cliff use commit_parsers in cliff.toml. Set hidden: true or skip: true to exclude types."
      },
      {
        "question": "Which tool should I use for a Python project?",

      {
        "question": "How do I migrate an existing project to Conventional Commits?",
        "answer": "Start by adding commitlint configuration and husky hooks, then use changelog_start_rev to begin tracking from a specific version. Previous commits can remain in old format while new commits follow the convention."

        "question": "What permissions do GitHub Actions need for automated releases?",
