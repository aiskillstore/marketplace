      {
        "question": "Can I trace requests across different programming languages?",
        "answer": "Yes. OpenTelemetry provides instrumentation libraries for all major languages and uses standard propagation formats. As long as all services propagate trace context headers, traces work across Python, Node.js, Go, Java, and other languages."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I correlate traces with logs?",
        "answer": "Extract the trace ID from the current span context and add it to your log entries as a structured field. This allows you to jump from a trace to related logs and vice versa for complete request visibility."
      },
      {
        "question": "What sampling strategy should I use?",
        "answer": "Start with probabilistic sampling at 1 percent for high-traffic services. Use higher rates for low-traffic services. Consider adaptive sampling that always traces errors while sampling successful requests at a lower rate."

      {
        "question": "How long should I retain trace data?",
        "answer": "Most teams retain traces for 7 to 30 days. Traces are useful for recent debugging but become less valuable over time. Configure retention based on your storage budget and compliance requirements."
