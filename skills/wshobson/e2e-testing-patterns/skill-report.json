    "faq": [
      {
        "question": "Should I use Playwright or Cypress for E2E testing?",
        "answer": "Both are excellent choices. Playwright offers better multi-browser support, faster execution, and native TypeScript support. Cypress provides a better debugging experience and simpler API for beginners. Choose based on your team's needs and existing tooling."
      },
      {
        "question": "How many E2E tests should I write compared to unit tests?",
        "answer": "Follow the testing pyramid: many unit tests, fewer integration tests, and only critical path E2E tests. E2E tests are slow and expensive, so focus on user workflows that would cause major business impact if broken, like authentication, checkout, and data submission."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I fix flaky tests that fail randomly in CI?",
        "answer": "Replace fixed timeouts with conditional waits, use stable selectors like data-testid instead of CSS classes, ensure tests are independent without shared state, and verify network requests complete before making assertions. The skill provides specific patterns for each scenario."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I use this skill with testing frameworks other than Playwright and Cypress?",
        "answer": "The patterns and principles apply broadly to E2E testing, but code examples are specific to Playwright and Cypress. Concepts like Page Object Model, waiting strategies, and network mocking translate to other frameworks with syntax adjustments."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I speed up my E2E test suite in CI pipelines?",
        "answer": "Use parallel execution with sharding to distribute tests across workers, mock external APIs to avoid network delays, run tests in headless mode, and only test critical paths with E2E while moving edge cases to faster integration tests."
      },
      {
        "question": "Should I test accessibility requirements with E2E tests?",
        "answer": "Yes, integrating accessibility testing with tools like axe-core in your E2E suite ensures accessibility is validated with real user interactions. This catches issues that static analysis might miss, like keyboard navigation and screen reader compatibility."
