        "question": "What is the purpose of git notes in this workflow?",

        "question": "How do I handle a task that cannot proceed due to dependencies?",

      },
      {
        "question": "How do I revert to a previous checkpoint?",
        "answer": "Use the checkpoint SHA to revert: git revert --no-commit <phase-commits>... then git commit -m \"revert: rollback to phase X checkpoint\". Checkpoints enable safe semantic reversion to known-good states."
