      {
        "question": "Does this skill work with WordPress plugins or only themes?",
        "answer": "This skill is designed specifically for WordPress theme analysis. It scans PHP and JavaScript files in a theme directory structure. Plugin analysis would require similar techniques but is not currently supported."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can the analyzer detect security vulnerabilities in WordPress themes?",
        "answer": "No, this is a testability analyzer, not a security scanner. It identifies elements for functional testing purposes. For security analysis, use dedicated WordPress security scanning tools."
      },
      {
        "question": "What output formats are supported by the analyzer?",
        "answer": "The skill generates either JSON output for automated test generation and programmatic consumption, or markdown format for human-readable documentation and review. Specify format using the --output flag."
      },
      {
        "question": "How does the analyzer handle dynamic content generated by WordPress at runtime?",
        "answer": "The analyzer performs static code analysis only. It identifies patterns like WP_Query and get_post_meta calls in the source code, but cannot detect content that is generated dynamically at runtime or retrieved from the database."
      },
      {
        "question": "Does the skill require a running WordPress installation to analyze themes?",
        "answer": "No, the analyzer works entirely on static files. It reads PHP and JavaScript files from the filesystem using regex pattern matching. No WordPress installation, database connection, or web server is required."
