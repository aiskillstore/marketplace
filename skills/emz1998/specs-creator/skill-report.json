        "question": "Does this skill write code?",

      },
      {
        "question": "Can I use this skill for existing projects?",
        "answer": "Yes, you can create specifications for existing features. Provide the feature description and any relevant context about the current implementation."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is the dependency chain?",
        "answer": "The skill follows a dependency chain: app-vision.md → prd.md → tech-specs.md → ux.md. This ensures documentation builds progressively from product vision through technical implementation to design details."
      },
      {
        "question": "How does validation work?",
        "answer": "The skill runs validation scripts that check specifications against template requirements. This ensures all required sections are present and properly formatted before the document is finalized."

      {
        "question": "Where are specifications saved?",
        "answer": "Specifications are saved to a designated specs/ directory within your project. The exact location depends on your project structure and will be included in the skill's output report."
