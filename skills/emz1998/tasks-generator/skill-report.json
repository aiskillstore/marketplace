        "question": "Does this skill integrate with Jira or other tools?",

        "question": "How does the parallel task marking work?",

      {
        "question": "What task ID format should I use?",
        "answer": "The skill supports sequential (T001, T002) or sprint-prefixed (SPRINT-001: T001-T009) formats. Choose one format and apply it consistently throughout the project."

      {
        "question": "Can I customize the output template?",
