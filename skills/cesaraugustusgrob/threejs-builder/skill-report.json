      {

        "question": "Can I use this with React or Vue?",
        "answer": "Yes, but you'll need to integrate the Three.js canvas element. Consider using react-three-fiber for React projects or mount the canvas in a Vue component's mounted hook."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I add this to my existing website?",
        "answer": "Copy the generated HTML file or extract the JavaScript into your project. Ensure you import Three.js from CDN or npm before your custom code."

      {
        "question": "Is Three.js free for commercial use?",

      },
      {
        "question": "Why is my scene black?",
        "answer": "You likely forgot to add lights. MeshStandardMaterial and most materials require lighting. Add at least an AmbientLight or use MeshBasicMaterial which doesn't need lights."
      },
      {
        "question": "How can I optimize performance?",
        "answer": "Reuse geometries and materials, limit shadow map resolution, use InstancedMesh for many objects, and keep triangle counts reasonable for your target devices."
