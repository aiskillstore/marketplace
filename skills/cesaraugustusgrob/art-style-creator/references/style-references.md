## Style Consistency Guidelines

### Style Bible Essentials

A comprehensive style guide should include:
1. **Core visual examples**: Key art showing the style in best form
2. **Do's and Don'ts**: Clear examples of correct and incorrect execution
3. **Color swatches**: Exact colors with codes
4. **Line samples**: Examples of correct line work
5. **Shape templates**: Base shapes for characters and objects
6. **Lighting diagrams**: Standard lighting setups
7. **Texture references**: Approved texture treatments
8. **Scale references**: Size relationships between elements

### Consistency Checklist

```
□ Colors match approved palette
□ Line weights are consistent
□ Shape language is maintained
□ Lighting direction is consistent within scene
□ Detail level matches zone (FG/MG/BG)
□ Proportions follow established ratios
□ Mood aligns with project tone
□ Technical specs are met
```

### Common Consistency Errors

| Error | Problem | Solution |
|-------|---------|----------|
| **Color drift** | Gradually straying from palette | Regular palette checks |
| **Line weight creep** | Inconsistent line thickness | Establish pixel/point standards |
| **Detail inflation** | Adding too much detail over time | Maintain reference checks |
| **Style mixing** | Combining incompatible approaches | Clear style rules |
| **Mood inconsistency** | Tone shifts inappropriately | Mood board reference |

### Multi-Artist Consistency

When multiple artists work on a project:
1. **Establish clear style guide** before production
2. **Create master examples** for reference
3. **Regular style reviews** with feedback
4. **Centralized asset library** with approved elements
5. **Style lead/Art director** for final approval
6. **Iterative refinement** of guidelines based on production needs
