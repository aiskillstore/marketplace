      {
        "question": "What exactly is a magic number or magic string?",
        "answer": "A magic number or string is a literal value in code without clear meaning or context. For example, if (users.length > 100) uses a magic number. Better would be const MAX_USERS = 100; if (users.length > MAX_USERS) which makes the intent clear."
      },
      {
        "question": "When should I use constants versus environment variables?",
        "answer": "Use constants for values that are the same across all environments like business rules or UI limits. Use environment variables for values that change between development, staging, and production like API URLs, database connections, or API keys."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are there any numbers that do not need to be extracted as constants?",
        "answer": "Yes, common values like 0, 1, -1 in obvious contexts like array indexing or simple math operations are acceptable. For example, array[0] or total / 2 are clear enough without constants."
      },
      {
        "question": "How does this skill help with security?",
        "answer": "This skill helps prevent accidentally committing sensitive credentials, API keys, or database passwords to version control by enforcing the use of environment variables for all sensitive values."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can this skill automatically refactor my code?",
        "answer": "Yes, when used with Claude Code, it can suggest specific refactorings and even apply them with your approval. It will extract constants, create proper file structures, and update environment variable configurations."
      },
      {
        "question": "What file structure does this skill recommend for constants?",
        "answer": "It recommends a constants directory with domain-specific files like constants/api.ts, constants/ui.ts, and constants/business.ts. Each exports const objects with meaningful names. A config/env.ts file handles environment variable validation and typing."
