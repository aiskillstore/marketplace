      {
        "question": "What is the difference between ghe-status and ghe-report?",

      },
      {
        "question": "Can ghe-status modify my issues?",
        "answer": "No. ghe-status is completely read-only. It only queries GitHub API and displays information. To modify issues, claim work, or transition phases, use other skills like ghe-claim, ghe-checkpoint, or ghe-transition."
      },
      {
        "question": "How often should I check the status?",
        "answer": "Check status at the start of every session to establish context. Check again after completing work to verify changes propagated correctly. Frequent checks help track workflow health over time."
      },
      {
        "question": "What do the phase distributions mean?",
        "answer": "Phases represent workflow stages: DEV (active development), TEST (verification), and REVIEW (final approval). Accumulation in any phase indicates potential bottlenecks. Balanced distribution suggests smooth workflow progress."
      },
      {
        "question": "Does ghe-status work with private repositories?",
        "answer": "Yes. ghe-status works with private repositories as long as the GitHub API token has appropriate read permissions for issues. The skill respects existing GitHub authentication."
      },
      {
        "question": "What are workflow violations?",
        "answer": "Workflow violations are instances where GitHub Elements conventions were not followed, such as missing checkpoints, improper phase transitions, or missing required labels. The status report flags these for attention."
