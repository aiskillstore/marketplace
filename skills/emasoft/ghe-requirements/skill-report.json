      {
        "question": "How do I version requirements properly?",
        "answer": "Use semantic versioning: PATCH for typos and clarifications, MINOR for added criteria or atomic changes, MAJOR for breaking changes to acceptance criteria. Always update the version field and revision history."
      },
      {
        "question": "What happens when requirements change?",
        "answer": "Bump the version, update the status, and notify all linked issues. Each linked issue must review the changes and potentially adjust implementation. The update must be committed to version control."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I skip requirements for small changes?",
        "answer": "No. Even small changes require requirements documentation. The require_agents setting in ghe.local.md can block DEV phase claims without linked requirements. Formal documentation prevents scope creep."
      },
      {
        "question": "How does SERENA backup work with requirements?",
        "answer": "The skill copies requirements files to .serena/memories/requirements/ for persistent storage. SERENA backup should occur after creation, updates, and before context compaction. This ensures requirements survive context exhaustion."
      },
      {
        "question": "Who approves requirements?",
        "answer": "Humans must approve requirements. The skill can change status from draft to approved after you review and validate the content. Automated agents cannot approve requirements - this requires human judgment."
