Use this skill when writing unit tests, integration tests, test files, test cases for critical workflows, or mocking external dependencies. Apply when working with test files (.test.js, .spec.ts, _test.py), test frameworks (Jest, RSpec, pytest), testing user journeys, or implementing fast-executing tests that validate business-critical functionality without over-testing implementation details or edge cases during feature development.",
