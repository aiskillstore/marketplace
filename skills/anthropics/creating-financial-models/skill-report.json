    "faq": [
      {
        "question": "What financial data do I need to provide for a DCF model?",
        "answer": "You need historical financials for context, revenue growth assumptions, EBITDA margin projections, capital expenditure estimates, working capital requirements, terminal growth rate, and WACC components including risk-free rate, beta, and market premium."
      },
      {
        "question": "How does this skill calculate WACC?",
        "answer": "The skill uses the CAPM formula for cost of equity (risk-free rate plus beta times market premium) and combines it with after-tax cost of debt weighted by the debt-to-equity ratio to determine the weighted average cost of capital."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can this skill access real-time stock prices or market data?",
        "answer": "No, this skill performs calculations based on inputs you provide. You must supply current market data, financial statements, and assumption parameters manually."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is the difference between perpetuity growth and exit multiple methods?",
        "answer": "Perpetuity growth calculates terminal value by assuming cash flows grow at a constant rate forever. Exit multiple applies an industry valuation multiple to final year EBITDA. Both methods are supported."
      },
      {
        "question": "How many scenarios should I run for sensitivity analysis?",
        "answer": "For basic analysis, test your top 3-5 assumptions with one-way sensitivity. For comprehensive analysis, use two-way tables for pairs of critical variables and run Monte Carlo with at least 1000 iterations for probability distributions."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is this suitable for professional investment decisions?",
        "answer": "This skill provides educational financial modeling tools based on standard methodologies. For professional investment decisions, you should validate results with qualified financial advisors and use institutional-grade analysis platforms."
