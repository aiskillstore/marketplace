      {
        "question": "How do I customize the brand guidelines for my own company?",
        "answer": "Edit the color codes, font names, tone keywords, and prohibited words in the BrandGuidelines configuration. Replace Acme Corporation examples with your organization name, tagline, and specific brand standards. The Python classes and validation logic remain the same."

      {
        "question": "How does the brand validation scoring work?",
        "answer": "The validator scans content for violations like unapproved colors, incorrect fonts, prohibited words, and brand name errors. Each violation deducts 10 points and each warning deducts 3 points from a base score of 100. A score of 100 means full compliance with zero violations."

      {
        "question": "Can I use this for web design and digital products?",
