      {
        "question": "What is the difference between swarm topologies?",

Star topology has central coordination with parallel agent execution. Ring topology creates sequential processing chains."

        "question": "How do I install Claude Flow MCP tools?",
        "answer": "Install Claude Flow globally with npm install -g claude-flow@alpha, then add the MCP server using claude mcp add claude-flow npx claude-flow@alpha mcp start. Verify installation by checking available MCP tools in Claude Code."

      {
        "question": "Can I use this skill without MCP tools installed?",

      },
      {
        "question": "How many agents should I use for a typical workflow?",
        "answer": "Start with 3 to 6 agents for most workflows. Research swarms work well with 4 to 6 agents. Development teams typically need 6 to 8 agents. Testing swarms can use 5 to 7 agents. Scale up only if parallelization benefits exceed coordination overhead."

        "question": "How does memory persistence work across swarm sessions?",

      },
      {
        "question": "What happens if an agent fails during execution?",
        "answer": "Enable fault tolerance with daa_fault_tolerance tool for auto-recovery. Monitor swarm health with swarm_status. Analyze errors with error_analysis tool. Implement retry logic for critical operations. Use state snapshots to recover from failures."
