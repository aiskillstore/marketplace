      "Training without validation data leads to overfitting that goes undetected until the agent is deployed in production environments",
      "Using excessively high learning rates causes training instability, divergence, and failure to converge to optimal policies",

      {
        "question": "Which algorithm should beginners start with?",
        "answer": "Decision Transformer is recommended for beginners because it trains stably from logged data without requiring online environment interaction or complex exploration."
      },
      {
        "question": "What are the minimum system requirements?",
        "answer": "Requires Node.js version 18 or higher and AgentDB version 1.0.7 or above. Training performance benefits from additional RAM and multiple CPU cores."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I integrate this with Claude Code?",
        "answer": "Import createAgentDBAdapter from agentic-flow/reasoningbank package and initialize with enableLearning set to true for full integration with Claude Code."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is my training data stored securely?",
        "answer": "AgentDB stores all data locally in the database path you specify. No training data or experiences are sent to external servers by default."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why is my model training not converging?",
        "answer": "Try reducing the learning rate, increasing training epochs, checking that experiences have properly formatted state and reward values, or using a smaller batch size."
      },
      {
        "question": "How does this differ from OpenAI RLHF?",
        "answer": "AgentDB focuses on reinforcement learning from environment interactions rather than human feedback. Use Decision Transformer for imitation learning from demonstrations."
