The static scanner misinterpreted vector distance formulas (cosine, euclidean, dot product) as cryptographic algorithms and markdown code block backticks as shell execution. Legitimate concerns include example IP addresses shown in QUIC configuration documentation and the inherent network synchronization capabilities that require proper firewall configuration. The skill is documentation-only with no executable code and includes its own security best practices.",
