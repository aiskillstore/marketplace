      {

        "answer": "Use Context for all stakeholders to show the big picture, Container for technical teams to show architecture, Component for developers working on specific parts, and Code sparingly for complex areas requiring detailed documentation."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I mix different levels in one diagram?",
        "answer": "No, mixing abstraction levels creates confusion. Each diagram should focus on one level. Create separate diagrams for different zoom levels and link them together."

      {
        "question": "What tools can render Mermaid C4 diagrams?",

      },
      {
        "question": "How many elements should be in a C4 diagram?",
        "answer": "Context diagrams should have 5 to 10 elements, Container diagrams 10 to 15, and Component diagrams 10 to 20. If you exceed these counts, consider splitting into multiple diagrams."
      },
      {
        "question": "Do I need to create all four levels?",
        "answer": "No, most systems only need Context and Container levels. Use Component for complex areas and Code level very sparingly for critical logic that requires detailed documentation."
