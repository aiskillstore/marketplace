Static analysis flagged 102 patterns related to security scanning tools (nmap, masscan, gobuster, enum4linux) and network operations. All findings are false positives - the skill contains no executable code, only documentation and example commands for authorized security testing. Risk level is medium due to dual-use nature of security tools, requiring users to have proper authorization. Content is appropriate for security professionals, CTF participants, and authorized penetration testers.",

    "faq": [
      {
        "question": "Is this skill safe to use for learning penetration testing?",
        "answer": "Yes, this skill provides educational content about reconnaissance methodologies. However, you must only apply these techniques in authorized environments such as your own lab systems, CTF competitions, or with explicit written permission from system owners."
      },
      {
        "question": "Does this skill perform actual network scanning?",
        "answer": "No, this skill only provides knowledge and methodologies. Claude Code would need to execute the documented commands using the Bash tool, and you must ensure you have proper authorization before running any security scanning tools."
      },
      {
        "question": "What tools do I need installed to use this skill?",
        "answer": "You need common penetration testing tools like nmap, gobuster, nikto, and other utilities mentioned in the skill. These are typically available in security-focused Linux distributions like Kali Linux or Parrot OS."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I use this skill for production network assessments?",
        "answer": "This skill provides foundational knowledge suitable for authorized security assessments. However, production assessments require additional considerations like client agreements, scope documentation, and professional pentesting methodologies beyond what this skill covers."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is the layered reconnaissance approach?",
        "answer": "The layered approach uses three escalation levels: Layer 1 performs quick scans with default settings, Layer 2 runs comprehensive scans with aggressive parameters if Layer 1 yields little information, and Layer 3 uses alternative tools or manual techniques when automated scans are insufficient."
      },
      {
        "question": "How does this skill help with CTF challenges?",
        "answer": "The skill provides systematic methodologies for discovering hidden services, directories, and vulnerabilities in CTF machines. The structured JSON output templates help organize findings, and the layered approach prevents wasting time on overly aggressive scans when quick enumeration suffices."
