      {
        "question": "How often should I update the vulnerability database?",
        "answer": "Run grype db update before each scan or at least daily. New CVEs are published continuously, so daily updates ensure you catch recent disclosures."

      {
        "question": "Can I use Grype without Docker installed?",
        "answer": "Yes, Grype can scan directories, SBOM files (Syft, SPDX, CycloneDX), and tar archives without Docker. Docker is only required for live container image scanning."
      },
      {
        "question": "How is my scan data handled?",
        "answer": "Grype downloads vulnerability metadata from public databases (NVD, GitHub Advisory Database). No scan results are sent anywhere unless you explicitly configure output or upload SARIF to GitHub Security."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why does Grype report vulnerabilities in packages I do not use?",
        "answer": "Grype scans all packages in the image including transitive dependencies. Use --only-fixed to show only vulnerabilities with available patches or create .grype.yaml ignore rules for false positives."

      {
        "question": "How does Grype compare to Trivy or Snyk?",
        "answer": "Grype is open-source, lightweight, and integrates well with CI/CD. Trivy offers more integrated registry scanning and Aqua provides commercial features. All three use similar vulnerability databases."
