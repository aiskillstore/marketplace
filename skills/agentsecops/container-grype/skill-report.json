        "question": "How often should I update the vulnerability database?",

        "question": "Can I use Grype without Docker installed?",

        "question": "How is my scan data handled and transmitted?",

      {
        "question": "Why does Grype report vulnerabilities in packages I do not use?",

        "question": "How does Grype compare to other container scanners like Trivy or Snyk?",
