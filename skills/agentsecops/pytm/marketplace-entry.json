  "description": "Python-based threat modeling using pytm library for programmatic STRIDE analysis, data flow diagram generation, and automated security threat identification. Use when: (1) Creating threat models programmatically using Python code, (2) Generating data flow diagrams (DFDs) with automatic STRIDE threat identification, (3) Integrating threat modeling into CI/CD pipelines and shift-left security practices, (4) Analyzing system architecture for security threats across trust boundaries, (5) Producing threat reports with STRIDE categories and mitigation recommendations, (6) Maintaining threat models as code for version control and automation.\n",
