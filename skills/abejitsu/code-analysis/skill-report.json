    "summary": "This is a legitimate code readability analyzer with no security concerns. All 44 static findings are FALSE POSITIVES. The 'Weak cryptographic algorithm' patterns are misidentified regex patterns for code analysis (analyzing variable names like 'usr_tkn', 'tmp', 'idx'). The 'Ruby/shell backtick execution' patterns are documentation code fences (markdown syntax), not actual shell commands. The 'C2 keywords' finding references 'webhook' as a technical term in a jargon list, not command-and-control infrastructure. The skill only reads user-specified files via command-line arguments, uses standard Python libraries (argparse, os, re, json, pathlib), and makes zero network requests. Capabilities match the stated purpose: analyzing code readability for non-developers.",
