    "faq": [
      {
        "question": "What is NativeWind and how does it differ from web Tailwind?",
        "answer": "NativeWind is a Tailwind CSS port for React Native. It brings utility classes to mobile but does not have full web parity. Some web Tailwind utilities are unsupported, and v2 breakpoints differ from web (sm: 640px, md: 768px, lg: 1024px, xl: 1280px)."
      },
      {
        "question": "When should I use StyleSheet.create versus NativeWind classes?",
        "answer": "Use StyleSheet for complex reused styles, performance-critical components, and iOS shadows. Use NativeWind for simple layout utilities, one-off styles, and conditional classes. A hybrid approach works best."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I handle light and dark mode with BrandColors?",
        "answer": "Create BrandColors and BrandColorsDark constant files. Use the useColorScheme hook from react-native to detect the current theme and return the appropriate color object. Pass these colors to components via the style prop."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why are my NativeWind classes not applying?",
        "answer": "Not all web Tailwind utilities work in NativeWind. Check the NativeWind v2 documentation for supported utilities. Also ensure you are using the className prop (not style) on React Native components."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I handle safe area on notched devices?",
        "answer": "Use SafeAreaView from react-native-safe-area-context with the edges prop, or use useSafeAreaInsets hook for manual control. NativeWind may have safe area utilities if configured."
      },
      {
        "question": "What causes style flicker on mount in React Native?",
        "answer": "Style flicker often occurs when styles are applied after the initial render. Use Animated API with useRef for Animated.Value to create smooth transitions instead of immediate style changes."
