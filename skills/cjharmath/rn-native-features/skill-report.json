      },
      {
        "question": "Can I use these features in the iOS simulator?",
        "answer": "Most native features require a physical device. Push notifications and haptics specifically do not work in simulators. Camera and location can work in simulators but behave differently than physical devices."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is the size limit for SecureStore?",
        "answer": "SecureStore has a limit of approximately 2KB per item. Use it for tokens and small credentials only. For larger sensitive data, consider encryption libraries that split data into chunks."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I handle permissions being permanently denied?",
        "answer": "When permission.status is 'denied' and permission.canAskAgain is false, show a UI element with a button that calls Linking.openSettings() to direct users to manually enable permissions."

      {
        "question": "Do I need a backend to send push notifications?",
