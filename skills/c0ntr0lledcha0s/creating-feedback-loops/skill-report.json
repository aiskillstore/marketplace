        "question": "How much time do feedback loops add to tasks?",
        "answer": "Initially 5-10 minutes to set up. With practice, self-review becomes fast, adding only seconds per response."

        "question": "Can I use this with other Claude Code skills?",
        "answer": "Yes. Combine with code review skills for enhanced quality gates or analysis skills for deeper pattern discovery."
      },
      {
        "question": "What data does this skill collect?",
        "answer": "None. This is a framework skill - you manually apply the templates and track what matters to you."
      },
      {
        "question": "What if I miss checkpoints during a session?",
        "answer": "Missing checkpoints is fine. The value is in consistent practice over time, not perfect adherence to every checkpoint."
      },
      {
        "question": "How is this different from just asking Claude to improve?",
        "answer": "This skill creates structured, repeatable processes. Manual asking is reactive; feedback loops are proactive and systematic."
