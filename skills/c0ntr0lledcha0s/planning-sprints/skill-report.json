      },
      {
        "question": "How do I calculate team capacity for a sprint?",
        "answer": "Multiply team size by sprint days by 5 to 6 productive hours per day. Then subtract time for meetings, PTO, holidays, and other commitments. Use 80 percent of this effective capacity for sprint commitment."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is a good sprint velocity?",
        "answer": "There is no universal good velocity because each team defines story points differently. Focus on consistency within your team and aim for a completion rate above 90 percent of committed points."
      },
      {
        "question": "How many story points should be in a sprint?",
        "answer": "Use your team historical velocity average from the last 3 to 5 sprints as the baseline. Commit to 80 percent of your calculated capacity to allow buffer for unknowns and urgent work."
      },
      {
        "question": "What if we are behind schedule mid sprint?",
        "answer": "Identify blockers first and try to remove them. If still behind, descope lower priority items with stakeholder approval to protect the sprint goal. Avoid extending the sprint duration."
