      {
        "question": "Can this skill automatically generate documentation by analyzing my code?",
        "answer": "No, this skill provides templates and best practices for writing documentation but does not automatically infer function behavior from code analysis. You need to provide information about what the code does, and the skill will format it properly."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I customize the documentation style for my project?",
        "answer": "The skill provides standard templates as starting points. You can request modifications to match your project style guide, such as changing the docstring format, adding custom sections, or adjusting the level of detail in examples."
      },
      {
        "question": "Does this work with documentation generation tools like JSDoc or Sphinx?",
        "answer": "Yes, the documentation formats generated by this skill are compatible with popular documentation tools. JSDoc comments work with JSDoc, TypeDoc, and similar tools. Python docstrings work with Sphinx, pdoc, and other Python documentation generators."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can this skill update existing documentation instead of creating new documentation?",
        "answer": "Yes, you can ask the skill to review and improve existing documentation. It can add missing sections, improve clarity, add examples, or reformat documentation to follow best practices while preserving your original content."

      {
        "question": "What is the difference between this skill and just asking Claude Code to write documentation?",
        "answer": "This skill provides specialized templates, language-specific formatting, and structured best practices for documentation. It ensures consistency, follows industry standards, and includes comprehensive sections like parameters, returns, errors, and examples that might be missed in general requests."
