      },
      {
        "question": "Can this skill fix issues it finds?",
        "answer": "No, the skill only identifies and reports issues like orphaned classes, missing fields, or duplicate IDs. It provides suggestions for fixes but does not modify files. You can use the suggestions to make changes manually or with other skills."
      },
      {
        "question": "How long does analysis take for large templates?",
        "answer": "Most analyses complete in under 30 seconds for templates up to 15,000 lines. Very large templates (20K+ lines) may take slightly longer. The skill uses efficient parsing and focuses on specific analysis types when requested."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is the difference between property types?",
        "answer": "Property types indicate how values are stored: :default is plain text, :node links to other pages, :date stores dates, :url stores links, and :number stores numeric values. This affects how Logseq handles and displays the property."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I compare my custom template against a standard one?",
        "answer": "Provide paths to both template files and ask to compare them. The skill will show class and property counts, unique items in each, and module-level differences to help identify what your custom template includes or excludes."
      },
      {
        "question": "What are orphaned classes and why do they matter?",
        "answer": "Orphaned classes lack a :build/class-parent reference (except Thing and Agent which are root classes). They break the inheritance hierarchy, meaning they cannot inherit shared properties from parent classes. This can lead to inconsistent data modeling."
