Risk factors include executable scripts and external commands, but these are standard tools (gh, jq) used for legitimate GitHub API operations. No credential theft, data exfiltration, or malicious patterns detected. Static findings of 'weak cryptographic algorithm' and 'C2 keywords' are false positives - scanner misidentified SHA256 hash strings and common English words in documentation as security threats.",
