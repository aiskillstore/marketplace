        "question": "How does ISR help with SEO compared to static generation?",

      },
      {
        "question": "Should I use metadata in layout.tsx or page.tsx?",
        "answer": "Use layout.tsx for default metadata that applies site-wide or to a section. Override specific fields in page.tsx for dynamic content like blog posts where title and description vary per page."
      },
      {
        "question": "What routes should I disallow in robots.txt?",
        "answer": "Disallow private routes like /api/, /admin/, /app/, and any routes containing sensitive data or infinite pagination. This saves crawl budget and prevents indexing of non-public content."

      {
        "question": "Can this skill automatically generate sitemaps for my existing application?",
        "answer": "No, this is a documentation skill that provides code examples and patterns. You must manually implement the sitemap generation code in your Next.js application following the examples provided."
