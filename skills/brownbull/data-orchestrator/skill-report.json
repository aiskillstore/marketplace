Accuracy validation ensuring amounts are positive and within expected ranges. Consistency rules checking that customer_ids exist in the customers table. Timeliness metrics confirming data arrives within 1 hour of transaction time. Uniqueness constraints on transaction_id. Validity checks for proper date formats and currency codes."

      {
        "question": "What is the minimum data quality score required?",

      },
      {
        "question": "How does the skill coordinate between different data tasks?",
        "answer": "The skill maintains pipeline state in ai-state/active/data directory using JSON files for pipelines, features, and quality metrics. It assigns tasks to specialized skills like etl-skill or feature-engineering-skill with full context packages including dependencies and standards."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can this skill execute actual ETL code?",
        "answer": "No, this is a coordination skill that orchestrates data workflows but does not execute processing code. It works with existing data infrastructure and tools, providing task coordination and quality enforcement."
      },
      {
        "question": "What happens when a pipeline fails quality checks?",
        "answer": "When quality checks fail, the skill logs the failure details, calculates quality scores, and can prevent data loading if below thresholds. It broadcasts events to notify other systems and updates the quality metrics in ai-state for tracking trends."
      },
      {
        "question": "How are feature dependencies tracked?",
        "answer": "Features are registered in features.json with explicit dependency arrays listing required tables and upstream features. The skill validates dependencies exist before execution and maintains version history for reproducibility."
      },
      {
        "question": "Does this work with real-time streaming data?",
        "answer": "Yes, the skill supports both batch and stream processing patterns. For streaming, it provides guidance on windowing, late arrival handling, and state management while maintaining the same quality standards."
