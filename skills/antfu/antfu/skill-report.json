        "question": "Do I need to use pnpm to follow these practices?",

      },
      {
        "question": "How do I integrate Vitest with these practices?",
        "answer": "Install Vitest and configure it with the recommended settings from this skill. Use @vitest/ui for visual test exploration and ensure your test files follow the naming convention (*.test.ts or *.spec.ts) for automatic discovery."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I use these practices with Vue or React projects?",
        "answer": "Yes. The configurations support Vue and React/Next.js. When configuring ESLint, enable the vue or react option in @antfu/eslint-config. The TypeScript and testing configurations work across frameworks."
      },
      {
        "question": "What VSCode settings are recommended?",
        "answer": "Use the VSCode extensions and settings outlined in this skill for format-on-save, ESLint integration, and TypeScript support. This ensures your editor automatically applies code quality checks as you write code."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I migrate an existing project to these practices?",
        "answer": "Start by installing the required dependencies and creating the configuration files. Run ESLint with --fix to auto-fix style issues. Gradually adopt the other practices like pre-commit hooks and CI/CD. The migration can be done incrementally."
