## Writing Guidelines

### Grammar and Style
- Use active voice: "We created" not "It was created by us"
- Write in second person: "You can access" not "Users can access"
- Use contractions: "We're" instead of "We are" (casual contexts)
- Avoid jargon: Explain technical terms when necessary
- Be concise: Remove unnecessary words
- Use parallel structure: Maintain consistency in lists

### Formatting
- Use sentence case for headings (not Title Case or ALL CAPS)
- Bold key terms on first use
- Use bullet points for lists of 3+ items
- Keep paragraphs short (3-4 sentences maximum)
- Use subheadings to break up long content

### Punctuation
- Use the Oxford comma: "red, white, and blue"
- Use one space after periods
- Avoid exclamation points (use sparingly, maximum one per page)
- Use em dashes (—) for emphasis, en dashes (–) for ranges

## Messaging Framework

### Brand Positioning

**Elevator Pitch Template:**
```
For [target audience]
Who [need/pain point]
[Brand name] is a [category]
That [key benefit/solution]
Unlike [competitors]
We [unique differentiator]
```

**Example:**
```
For growing businesses
Who struggle with disorganized customer data
Acme CRM is a customer management platform
That centralizes all customer interactions in one place
Unlike complex enterprise solutions
We offer enterprise features with startup simplicity
```

### Key Messages

**Primary Message:** The main benefit or value proposition
```
"We help teams work smarter, not harder, with intuitive collaboration tools."
```

**Secondary Messages:** Supporting benefits (typically 3-5)
```
1. "Save 10+ hours per week with automated workflows"
2. "Keep everyone aligned with real-time updates"
3. "Access your work anywhere, on any device"
4. "Scale seamlessly as your team grows"
```

**Proof Points:** Evidence supporting your messages
```
1. "Trusted by 50,000+ teams worldwide"
2. "4.8/5 star rating from 10,000+ reviews"
3. "99.9% uptime SLA guarantee"
```

### Call-to-Action (CTA) Guidelines

**CTA Button Text:**
- Use action verbs: "Start," "Get," "Download," "Try"
- Be specific: "Start Free Trial" not just "Get Started"
- Create urgency when appropriate: "Claim Your Spot"
- Keep it brief: 2-4 words maximum

**CTA Hierarchy:**
```
Primary CTA: High-contrast brand color, prominent placement
Secondary CTA: Outlined or subtle styling
Tertiary CTA: Text link only
```

**Examples:**
```
Primary: "Start Free Trial" (brand blue button)
Secondary: "Watch Demo" (outlined button)
Tertiary: "Learn more →" (text link)
```

## Voice Characteristics in Action

### Professional but Approachable

**Good:** "We're here to help you succeed. Our expert team has years of experience, and we're ready to share that knowledge with you."

**Too Formal:** "It is the intention of this organization to facilitate your success through the provision of professional services by our experienced personnel."

**Too Casual:** "Hey! We're total pros and we wanna help you crush it! Hit us up anytime!"

### Clear and Direct

**Good:** "Save 30% on your subscription when you upgrade today."

**Too Vague:** "There may be opportunities for cost optimization through strategic purchasing decisions."

**Too Blunt:** "Stop wasting money. Upgrade now."

### Authentic and Confident

**Good:** "We've helped thousands of businesses streamline their operations. We're confident we can help you too."

**Not Confident:** "We think we might be able to help you, maybe."

**Arrogant:** "We're the best solution on the market. Everyone else is just copying us."
