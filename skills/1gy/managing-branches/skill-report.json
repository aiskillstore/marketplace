The static scanner incorrectly flagged multiple findings: the 'weak cryptographic algorithm' detections are false positives (the scanner misidentified strings like 'managing-branches' and 'Quick branch status check' as crypto references). The 'external_commands' findings show standard Git commands (git branch, git status, git checkout) that are safe for a branch management skill. The 'filesystem' and 'network' findings are metadata strings, not actual access calls. The skill only uses safe Git commands and does not perform destructive operations.",
