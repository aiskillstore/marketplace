The static scanner produced 35 false positives due to misclassification: template placeholders like <branch-name> were flagged as 'weak cryptographic algorithms', and standard shell commands were flagged as 'Ruby/shell backtick execution'. In reality, this skill only documents standard git commands (branch, status, push) and GitHub CLI PR creation. No code execution occurs beyond user-initiated git/gh commands. The original AI audit correctly classified this as safe.",
