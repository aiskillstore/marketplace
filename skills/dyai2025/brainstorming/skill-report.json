        "question": "How does this skill differ from regular planning?",
        "answer": "This skill focuses on ideation and design refinement through structured questioning and alternative exploration. It precedes planning by helping you arrive at a validated design. After brainstorming completes, you can use the writing-plans skill for implementation planning."

      {
        "question": "Can I skip phases if I already know what I want?",
        "answer": "The skill allows flexible progression, but exploring alternatives in Phase 2 often reveals better approaches even when you think you know the solution. You can move quickly through phases but should not skip the alternative exploration entirely."
      },
      {
        "question": "What happens after the design is validated?",
        "answer": "After design validation, the skill can invoke the using-git-worktrees skill to set up an isolated workspace, then use the writing-plans skill to create a detailed implementation plan in that workspace."

        "question": "Does this skill write any code?",

      {
        "question": "How does the AskUserQuestion tool integration work?",
        "answer": "The skill uses the AskUserQuestion tool during understanding and exploration phases to present structured choices with descriptions and trade-offs. This ensures clear decision-making and prevents vague responses when evaluating alternatives."
