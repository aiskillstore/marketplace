    "faq": [
      {
        "question": "Does this skill require any external tools or dependencies?",

      {
        "question": "Can I customize the format and style of the generated changelog?",
        "answer": "Yes, you can reference your own changelog style guide document when invoking the skill. It will adapt the output to match your specified formatting, tone, and categorization preferences."
      },
      {
        "question": "How does the skill categorize commits into different sections?",
        "answer": "The skill analyzes commit messages and changes to automatically group them into categories like features, improvements, bug fixes, breaking changes, and security updates. It uses semantic understanding of the commit content rather than relying solely on commit message conventions."
      },
      {
        "question": "Will this skill include internal development commits in the changelog?",
        "answer": "No, the skill automatically filters out internal commits such as refactoring, test updates, build changes, and other development tasks that are not relevant to end users. It focuses on user-facing changes."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I use this for generating changelogs in languages other than English?",
        "answer": "Yes, Claude supports multiple languages. You can specify your desired output language in your prompt, and the skill will generate the changelog in that language while translating technical terms appropriately."
      },
      {
        "question": "How accurate is the translation from technical commits to user-friendly language?",
        "answer": "The quality depends on your original commit messages. Clear, descriptive commits produce better changelogs. You should always review the output before publishing to ensure accuracy and adjust any descriptions that need clarification or better positioning."
