        "question": "Which model should I use for my avatar videos?",
        "answer": "Use OmniHuman 1.5 for multi-character videos and best quality. Use Fabric 1.0 for static images that need to speak. Use PixVerse Lipsync for highly realistic lip sync on existing images."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I create videos in languages other than English?",
        "answer": "Yes, you can create videos in any language supported by the kokoro-tts text-to-speech model. Use the dubbing workflow to create multilingual versions of existing videos."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I authenticate with inference.sh?",
        "answer": "Run infsh login in your terminal. You'll need to authenticate with your inference.sh account credentials. This provides access to all available AI models."
      },
      {
        "question": "What image formats work best for avatar videos?",
        "answer": "Use high-resolution portrait photos (400x400 or larger) with front-facing orientation. JPG and PNG formats work well. Good lighting and neutral background produce better results."

      {
        "question": "Can I use this skill with Claude Code?",
        "answer": "Yes, this skill is compatible with Claude, Codex, and Claude Code. You can use the command examples in SKILL.md with Claude Code to build automated video generation workflows."
