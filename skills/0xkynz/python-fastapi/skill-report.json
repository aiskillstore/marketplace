        "question": "How does the feature-based architecture work?",

      },
      {
        "question": "What database support is included?",
        "answer": "The template supports PostgreSQL with asyncpg for production and SQLite with aiosqlite for testing. SQLAlchemy 2.0 async patterns are used throughout for non-blocking database operations."
      },
      {
        "question": "How is authentication implemented?",

        "question": "Can I use this for GraphQL APIs?",
