Early detection through screening programs has been shown to significantly reduce the risk of severe vision impairment (Looker et al., 2013). However, access to expert ophthalmologists for screening remains limited in many regions, particularly in low-resource settings (Bourne et al., 2013). Recent advances in deep learning have shown promise for automated diabetic retinopathy detection, with several studies reporting performance comparable to human experts (Ting et al., 2017). Despite these advances, challenges remain in deploying robust models across diverse clinical settings with varying image quality and patient populations. The present study aimed to develop and validate a machine learning algorithm for early detection of diabetic retinopathy using a multi-site cohort of 500 patients, addressing the need for scalable screening solutions in diverse clinical environments."
