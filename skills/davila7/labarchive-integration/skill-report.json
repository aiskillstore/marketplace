All 264 static findings are false positives caused by the scanner misinterpreting markdown code blocks as shell commands and flagging documentation references to encryption concepts. The actual Python code implements secure credential handling with 0o600 file permissions, makes documented API calls only to LabArchives servers, and performs standard file operations for backups. No malicious patterns, credential exfiltration, or suspicious network behavior detected.",
