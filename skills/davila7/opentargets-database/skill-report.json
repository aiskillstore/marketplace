The static scanner produced 152 false positives primarily by misclassifying markdown code formatting backticks as shell commands, biomedical terminology as system reconnaissance, and variable names containing 'crypt' as weak cryptography. The actual Python code only makes GraphQL requests to https://api.platform.opentargets.org/api/v4/graphql with no filesystem access, command execution, or data exfiltration. All behavior matches the stated purpose of querying therapeutic target data.",
